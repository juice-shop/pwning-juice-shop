____

As a project of the OWASP Foundation the Juice Shop is and always will
be

* open source
* free software

The entire project is licensed under the liberal
https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT license] which allows even
commercial use and modifications. There will never be an "enterprise",
"pro" or "premium" version of OWASP Juice Shop either.

This does not mean that a project like it can thrive without any
funding. Some examples on what the OWASP Juice Shop spent (or might
spend) money on:

* Giveaways for conferences and meetups (e.g.
https://www.stickeryou.com/products/owasp-juice-shop/794[stickers, magnets, iron-ons or temporary tattoos])
* Merchandise to reward awesome project contributions or marketing for
the project (e.g.
http://shop.spreadshirt.com/juiceshop[apparel or mugs])
* Bounties on a small number of features or fixes
* Software license costs (e.g. an extended icon library)
* Commercial support where the team lacks expertise (e.g. graphics
design for this book's cover was paid from donations)

== Supporting Juice Shop

The OWASP Foundation gratefully accepts donations via Stripe. Projects
such as Juice Shop can then request reimbursement for expenses (like
those listed above) from the Foundation.

== Restricted gifts

All donations of at least 1000 US$ to the OWASP Foundation can be

ℹ️ _While the Juice Shop appreciates such dedicated donations, please
note that these add an organizational overhead for the OWASP Foundation.
To this day no expenses of the categories mentioned above have ever been
denied by OWASP for Juice Shop. Feel free to use a regular donation with
attribution instead._

== Attribution

If you tick the "Publicly list me as a supporter of OWASP Juice Shop"
checkbox your name (but obviously *not* your email address) will be
added to the
https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/#div-supporters[_Supporters_ tab of the project website]
automatically.

For donation amounts of at least 1000 US$ your corporate logo (with
link) will be added to the _Top Supporters_ section as well. The logo
size can be at most 300x300 pixels. Logo and name placements are
guaranteed for 1 year after the donation but might stay there longer at
the discretion of the Project Leader.
