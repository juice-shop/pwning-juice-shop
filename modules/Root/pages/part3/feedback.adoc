* Were you sure to have solved a challenge but it did not light up on
the score board?
* Do you think you found an _accidental_ vulnerability that could be
included and tracked on the score board?
* Do you disagree with the difficulty rating for some challenges?
* Did you spot a misbehaving UI component or broken image?
* Did you enjoy a conference talk, podcast or video about OWASP Juice
Shop that is missing in our
