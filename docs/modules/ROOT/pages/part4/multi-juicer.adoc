A solution to host and manage individual Juice Shop instances for
multiple users is
https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer/[MultiJuicer]. MultiJuicer is
a Kubernetes based system to start up the required Juice Shop instances
on demand. It will also clean up unused instances after a configured
period of inactivity.

MultiJuicer {multiJuicerVersion} comes with a custom-built load balancer. It allows every
participant (or a CTF team) to use the same URL, but their traffic will
always be sent to their own personal (or team-specific) instance.

Registration at MultiJuicer is very straightforward for the users/teams.
Messing with other instances is prevented by assigning a passcode to
each of them which should only be shared among team members - or not at
all for individuals.

MultiJuicer comes with a rudimentary Score Board of its own, which allows teams to compare their progress through
the Juice Shop challenges.

Another helpful feature for trainers and CTf-organizers is the https://github.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer/blob/main/guides/monitoring-setup/monitoring.md[optional
dashboard which automatically consumes and displays metrics] from each of
its Juice Shop instances. It shows individual challenge progress along with other
functional and technical stats and can be very helpful in
troubleshooting as well.
