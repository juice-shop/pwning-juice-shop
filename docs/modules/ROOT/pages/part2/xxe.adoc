= XML External Entities (XXE)[[_xxe]]

include::../attributes.adoc[]

____
An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an
application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input
containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly
configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of
confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery,
port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is
located, and other system impacts.

The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The
standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit
of some type. There are a few different types of entities, external
general/parameter parsed entity often shortened to external entity,
that can access local or remote content via a declared system
identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be
dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the
entity. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named
external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system
identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML
processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may
disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the
application. Similar attack vectors apply the usage of external DTDs,
external stylesheets, external schemas, etc. which, when included,
allow similar external resource inclusion style attacks.

Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain
sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file:
schemes or relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack
occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an
attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal
systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via http(s)
requests or launching a CSRF attack to any unprotected internal
services. In some situations, an XML processor library that is
vulnerable to client-side memory corruption issues may be exploited by
dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code
execution under the application account. Other attacks can access
local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting
application availability if too many threads or processes are not
released.

Note that the application does not need to explicitly return the
response to the attacker for it to be vulnerable to information
disclosures. An attacker can leverage DNS information to exfiltrate
data through subdomain names to a DNS server that he/she controls.footnote:3_14_1[https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing]

== Challenges covered in this chapter

|===
| Name | Description | Difficulty

| XXE Data Access
| Retrieve the content of `C:\Windows\system.ini` or `/etc/passwd` from the server.
| ⭐⭐⭐

| XXE DoS
| Give the server something to chew on for quite a while.
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
|===

ℹ️ _Please note that both XXE challenges described below are *not
available* when running the Juice Shop in either a Docker container or
on a Heroku dyno! Certain aggressive attacks against the underlying XML
parser caused the process to die from "Segmentation Fault" (`segfault`)
errors. This happens despite the fact that the parsing actually happens
in a sandbox with a timeout. While it is unfortunate to not have XXE
challenges on containerized environments, this somewhat nicely shows how
incredibly dangerous ill-configured XML parsers actually are._

== Retrieve the content of C:\Windows\system.ini or /etc/passwd from the server

In this challenge you are tasked to disclose a local file from the
server the Juice Shop backend is hosted on.

== Give the server something to chew on for quite a while

Similar to
xref:part2/injection.adoc#_let_the_server_sleep_for_some_time[Let the server sleep for some time]
this challenge is about performing a stripped-down __denial-of-service__
attack. But this one is going against an entirely different leverage
point.
