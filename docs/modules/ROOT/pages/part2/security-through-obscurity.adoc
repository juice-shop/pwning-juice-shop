= Security through Obscurity

include::../attributes.adoc[]

Many applications contain content which is not supposed to be publicly
accessible. A properly implemented authorization model would ensure that
only users _with appropriate permission_ can access such content. If an
application instead relies on the fact that the content is _not visible
anywhere_, this is called "security through obscurity" which is a severe
anti-pattern:

____
In security engineering, security through obscurity (or security by
obscurity) is the reliance on the secrecy of the design or
implementation as the main method of providing security for a system
or component of a system. A system or component relying on obscurity
may have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities, but its
owners or designers believe that if the flaws are not known, that will
be sufficient to prevent a successful attack. Security experts have
rejected this view as far back as 1851, and advise that obscurity
should never be the only security mechanism.footnote:3_9_1[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity]

== Learn about the Token Sale before its official announcement

Juice Shop does not want to miss out on the chance to gain some easy
extra funding, so it prepared to launch a "Token Sale" (synonymous for
"Initial Coin Offering") to sell its newly invented cryptocurrency to
its customers and future investors. This challenge is about finding the
prepared-but-not-yet-published page about this ICO in the application.

____
An initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of
crowdfunding centered around cryptocurrency, which can be a source of
capital for startup companies. In an ICO, a quantity of the
crowdfunded cryptocurrency is preallocated to investors in the form of
"tokens", in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies such
as bitcoin or ethereum. These tokens supposedly become functional
units of currency if or when the ICO's funding goal is met and the
project launches.

ICOs provide a means by which startups avoid costs of regulatory
compliance and intermediaries, such as venture capitalists, bank and
stock exchanges, while increasing risk for investors. ICOs may fall
outside existing regulations or may need to be regulated depending on
the nature of the project, or are banned altogether in some
jurisdictions, such as China and South Korea.

[...] The term may be analogous with "token sale" or crowdsale,
which refers to a method of selling participation in an economy,
giving investors access to the features of a particular project
starting at a later date. ICOs may sell a right of ownership or
royalties to a project, in contrast to an initial public offering
which sells a share in the ownership of the company itself.footnote:3_9_2[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering]

== Prove that you actually read our privacy policy

User agreements and privacy policies are too often simply dismissed or
blindly accepted. This challenge kind of forces you to reconsider that
approach.

== Rat out a notorious character hiding in plain sight in the shop

____
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or
video within another file, message, image, or video. The word
steganography combines the Greek words steganos (στεγανός), meaning
"covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein (γράφειν) meaning
"writing".

The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius
in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography,
disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to
be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping
lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may
be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter.
Some implementations of steganography that lack a shared secret are
forms of security through obscurity, and key-dependent steganographic
schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs's principle.

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the
intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an
object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how
unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be
incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.

Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a
message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact
that a secret message is being sent as well as concealing the contents
of the message.

Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer
files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include
steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document
file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for
steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example,
a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color
of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet.
The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking
for it is unlikely to notice the change.footnote:3_9_3[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography]
