== Gain access to any access log file of the server

____
An access log is a list of all the requests for individual files that
people have requested from a Web site. These files will include the
HTML files and their imbedded graphic images and any other associated
files that get transmitted. The access log (sometimes referred to as
the "raw data") can be analyzed and summarized by another program.

In general, an access log can be analyzed to tell you:

The number of visitors (unique first-time requests) to a home page The
origin of the visitors in terms of their associated server's domain
name (for example, visitors from .edu, .com, and .gov sites and from
the online services) How many requests for each page at the site,
which can be presented with the pages with most requests listed first
Usage patterns in terms of time of day, day of week, and seasonally
Access log keepers and analyzers can be found as shareware on the Web
or may come with a Web server.footnote:3_10_1[https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/access-log]
____

The Juice Shop application server is writing access logs, which can
contain interesting information that competitors might also be
interested in.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/accessLogDisclosureChallenge.adoc[]

== Access a confidential document

Somewhere in the application you can find a file that contains sensitive
information about some - potentially hostile - takeovers the Juice Shop
top management has planned.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/directoryListingChallenge.adoc[]

== Perform an unwanted information disclosure by accessing data cross-domain

Somewhere in the application there is an API endpoint which will allow
data to be accessed cross domain. Usually the same-origin policy would
prevent this but this endpoint has a special feature enabled which will
allow cross domain access under certain circumstances.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/emailLeakChallenge.adoc[]

== A developer was careless with hardcoding unused but still valid credentials

include::ROOT:partial$hints/exposedCredentialsChallenge.adoc[]

== Find the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a popular monitoring system

The popular monitoring system being referred to in the challenge
description is https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus[Prometheus]:

____
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many
companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project
has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone
open source project and maintained independently of any company. To
emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure,
Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the
second hosted project, after Kubernetes. footnote:3_10_6[https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/]
____

____
RTFM is an initialism for the expression "read the fucking manual".
footnote:3_10_7[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM]
____

== Access a developer's forgotten backup file

During an emergency incident and the hotfix that followed, a developer
accidentally pasted an application configuration file into the wrong
place. Downloading this file will not only solve the _Access a
developer's forgotten backup file_ challenge but might also prove
crucial in several other challenges later on.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/forgottenDevBackupChallenge.adoc[]

== Access a salesman's forgotten backup file

A salesperson as accidentally uploaded a list of (by now outdated)
coupon codes to the application. Downloading this file will not only
solve the _Access a salesman's forgotten backup file_ challenge but
might also prove useful in another challenge later on.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/forgottenBackupChallenge.adoc[]

== Steal someone else's personal data without using Injection

In order to comply with GDPR, the Juice Shop offers a _Request Data
Export_ function for its registered customers. It is possible to exploit
a flaw in the feature to retrieve more data than intended. Injection
attacks will not count to solve this one.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/dataExportChallenge.adoc[]

== Dumpster dive the Internet for a leaked password and log in to the original user account it belongs to

The company behind the Juice Shop failed miserably at implementing any
data loss prevention measures for itself. This challenge simulates a
seemingly harmless data leak that - upon closer inspection -
subsequently allows an account takeover.

____
*Data loss prevention software* detects potential data breaches/data
ex-filtration transmissions and prevents them by monitoring, detecting
and blocking sensitive data while in use (endpoint actions), in motion
(network traffic), and at rest (data storage).

The terms "data loss" and "data leak" are related and are often used
interchangeably. Data loss incidents turn into data leak incidents in
cases where media containing sensitive information is lost and
subsequently acquired by an unauthorized party. However, a data leak
is possible without losing the data on the originating side. Other
terms associated with data leakage prevention are information leak
detection and prevention (ILDP), information leak prevention (ILP),
content monitoring and filtering (CMF), information protection and
control (IPC) and extrusion prevention system (EPS), as opposed to
intrusion prevention system. footnote:3_10_2[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss_prevention_software]
____

include::ROOT:partial$hints/dlpPasswordSprayingChallenge.adoc[]

____
Password spraying refers to the attack method that takes a large
number of usernames and loops them with a single password. We can use
multiple iterations using a number of different passwords, but the
number of passwords attempted is usually low when compared to the
number of users attempted. This method avoids password lockouts, and
it is often more effective at uncovering weak passwords than targeting
specific users.footnote:3_10_5[https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/password-spraying/]
____

== Inform the shop about a leaked API key

____
Public REST services without access control run the risk of being farmed leading to excessive bills for bandwidth or compute cycles. API keys can be used to mitigate this risk. They are also often used by organisation to monetize APIs; instead of blocking high-frequency calls, clients are given access in accordance to a purchased access plan.

API keys can reduce the impact of denial-of-service attacks. However, when they are issued to third-party clients, they are relatively easy to compromise.footnote:3_10_8[https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#api-keys]
____

== Identify an unsafe product that was removed from the shop and inform the shop which ingredients are dangerous

Similar to
<<_dumpster_dive_the_internet_for_a_leaked_password_and_log_in_to_the_original_user_account_it_belongs_to,Dumpster dive the Internet for a leaked password and log in to the original user account it belongs to>>
this challenge further highlights the risks from a lack of data loss
prevention.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/dlpPastebinDataLeakChallenge.adoc[]

== Log in with Amy's original user credentials

This challenge is similar to
xref:part2/broken-authentication.adoc#_log_in_with_the_administrators_user_credentials_without_previously_changing_them_or_applying_sql_injection[Log in with the administrators user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection]
in the sense that only using her original credentials will work as a

include::ROOT:partial$hints/loginAmyChallenge.adoc[]

== Log in with MC SafeSearch's original user credentials

Another user login challenge where only the original password is
accepted as a solution. Employing SQL Injection or other attacks does
not count.

== Determine the answer to John's security question

Who would have guessed that a simple walk in the park could lead to an
account compromise. People these days are not careful with what they
post online and are not aware of the possible consequences it can have
when people exploit that.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/geoStalkingMetaChallenge.adoc[]

== Access a misplaced SIEM signature file.

____
Security information and event management (SIEM) technology supports
threat detection and security incident response through the real-time
collection and historical analysis of security events from a wide
variety of event and contextual data sources. It also supports
compliance reporting and incident investigation through analysis of
historical data from these sources. The core capabilities of SIEM
technology are a broad scope of event collection and the ability to
correlate and analyze events across disparate sources.footnote:3_10_3[https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem/]
____

The misplaced signature file is actually a rule file for
https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma[Sigma], a generic signature format
for SIEM systems:

____
Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to
describe relevant log events in a straight forward manner. The rule
format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of
log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured
form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once
developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.

Sigma is for log files what Snort is for network traffic and YARA is
for files.footnote:3_10_4[https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma#what-is-sigma]
____

include::ROOT:partial$hints/misplacedSignatureFileChallenge.adoc[]

== Take over the wallet containing our official Soul Bound Token

include::ROOT:partial$hints/nftUnlockChallenge.adoc[]

== Reset Uvogin's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

With the amount of personal information that people tend to reveal
online, security questions are hardly reliable anymore.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/resetPasswordUvoginChallenge.adoc[]

== Deprive the shop of earnings by downloading the blueprint for one of its products

Why waste money for a product when you can just as well get your hands
on its blueprint in order to make it yourself?

include::ROOT:partial$hints/retrieveBlueprintChallenge.adoc[]

ℹ️ _If you are running the Juice Shop with a custom theme and product
inventory, the product to inspect will be a different one. The tooltip
on the Score Board will tell you which one to look into._

== Determine the answer to Emma's security question

It is also possible to determine where a picture was taken by looking at
visual clues within the image. A certain user has uploaded a picture of
his old workplace. Take a look at what his security question is and see
if you can find the answer by looking at his uploaded image.
