== Read our privacy policy

____
A privacy policy is a statement or a legal document (in privacy law)
that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses,
discloses, and manages a customer or client's data. It fulfills a
legal requirement to protect a customer or client's privacy. Personal
information can be anything that can be used to identify an
individual, not limited to the person's name, address, date of birth,
marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiry date,
financial records, credit information, medical history, where one
travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services. In the case of
a business it is often a statement that declares a party's policy on
how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it
collects. It informs the client what specific information is
collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners,
or sold to other firms or enterprises. Privacy policies typically
represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to data
use statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific.

The exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the
applicable law and may need to address requirements across
geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions. Most countries have
their own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, what
information can be collected, and what it can be used for. In general,
data protection laws in Europe cover the private sector as well as the
public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government
operations but also to private enterprises and commercial
transactions.footnote:3_7_1[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy]

== Behave like any "white hat" should before getting into the action

____
The term "white hat" in Internet slang refers to an ethical computer
hacker, or a computer security expert, who specializes in penetration
testing and in other testing methodologies to ensure the security of
an organization's information systems. Ethical hacking is a term meant
to imply a broader category than just penetration testing. Contrasted
with black hat, a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films,
where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white
and a black hat respectively.footnote:3_7_2[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)]
