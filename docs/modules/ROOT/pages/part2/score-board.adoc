include::../attributes.adoc[]

In part 1 you were introduced to the Score Board and learned how it
tracks your challenge hacking progress. You also had a "happy path" tour
through the Juice Shop application from the perspective of a regular
customer without malicious intentions. But you never saw the Score
Board, did you?

== Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page

Why was the Score Board not visited during the "happy path" tour?
Because there seemed to be no link anywhere in the application that
would lead you there! You know that it must exist, which leaves two
possible explanations:

. You missed the link during the initial mapping of the application
. There is a URL that leads to the Score Board but it is not
hyperlinked to

--
* Try to find a reference or clue behind the scenes. Or simply guess what URL the Score Board might have.
* Guessing the URL is quite easy if you consider the structure of other frontend paths in the application.
