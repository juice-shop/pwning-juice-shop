= Cross Site Scripting (XSS)[[_xss]]

include::../attributes.adoc[]

____
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web
sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script,
to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from
a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding
it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the
script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by
the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite
the content of the HTML page.footnote:3_13_1[https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/]

== Perform a persisted XSS attack without using the frontend application at all

As presented in the
xref:introduction/architecture.adoc#_architecture_overview[Architecture Overview], the OWASP Juice
Shop uses a JavaScript client on top of a RESTful API on the server
side. Even without giving this fact away in the introduction chapter,
you would have quickly figured this out looking at their interaction
happening on the network. Most actions on the UI result in
`XMLHttpRequest` (`XHR`) objects being sent and responded to by the
server.

For the XSS Tier 3 challenge it is necessary to work with the
server-side API directly. You will need a command line tool like `curl`
or a
xref:part1/rules.adoc#_tools_for_http_request_tampering[tool for HTTP request tampering]
to master this challenge.

== Use the bonus payload in the DOM XSS challenge

The underlying vulnerability of this challenge is the same as for the
<<_perform_a_dom_xss_attack,Perform a DOM XSS attack>> challenge. The
effect of the payload is much more entertaining, though.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/xssBonusChallenge.adoc[]

== Bypass the Content Security Policy and perform an XSS attack on a legacy page

In the xref:introduction/architecture.adoc#_architecture_overview[Architecture overview] you were
told that the Juice Shop uses a modern __Single Page Application__
frontend. That was not entirely true.

____
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps
to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site
Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for
everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of
malware.

CSP is designed to be fully backward compatible ([...]). Browsers
that don't support it still work with servers that implement it, and
vice-versa: browsers that don't support CSP simply ignore it,
functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard same-origin policy
for web content. If the site doesn't offer the CSP header, browsers
likewise use the standard same-origin policy.

To enable CSP, you need to configure your web server to return the
Content-Security-Policy HTTP header ([...]).footnote:3_13_5[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP]

== Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism

This challenge is founded on a very common security flaw of web
applications, where the developers ignored the following golden rule of
input validation:

____
Be aware that any JavaScript input validation performed on the client
can be bypassed by an attacker that disables JavaScript or uses a Web
Proxy. Ensure that any input validation performed on the client is
also performed on the server.footnote:3_13_4[https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet]

== Perform a DOM XSS attack

____
DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting is the de-facto name for XSS bugs which
are the result of active browser-side content on a page, typically
JavaScript, obtaining user input and then doing something unsafe with
it which leads to execution of injected code.

The DOM, or Document Object Model, is the structural format used to
represent documents in a browser. The DOM enables dynamic scripts such
as JavaScript to reference components of the document such as a form
field or a session cookie. The DOM is also used by the browser for
security - for example to limit scripts on different domains from
obtaining session cookies for other domains. A DOM-based XSS
vulnerability may occur when active content, such as a JavaScript
function, is modified by a specially crafted request such that a DOM
element that can be controlled by an attacker.footnote:3_13_3[https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_DOM-based_Cross_site_scripting_(OTG-CLIENT-001)]

== Perform a persisted XSS attack through an HTTP header

This XSS challenge originates from an unsafely processed user input via
an HTTP header. The difficulty lies in finding the attack path whereas
the actual exploit is rather business as usual.

include::ROOT:partial$hints/httpHeaderXssChallenge.adoc[]

== Perform a reflected XSS attack

____
Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occur when an attacker injects
browser executable code within a single HTTP response. The injected
attack is not stored within the application itself; it is
non-persistent and only impacts users who open a maliciously crafted
link or third-party web page. The attack string is included as part of
the crafted URI or HTTP parameters, improperly processed by the
application, and returned to the victim.footnote:3_13_2[https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_(OWASP-DV-001)]

== Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a server-side security mechanism

This is one of the hardest XSS challenges, as it cannot be solved by
just fiddling with the client-side JavaScript or bypassing the client
entirely. Whenever there is a server-side validation or input processing
involved, you should investigate how it works. Finding out
implementation details e.g. used libraries, modules or algorithms -
should be your priority. If the application does not leak this kind of
details, you can still go for a _blind approach_ by testing lots and
lots of different attack payloads and check the reaction of the
application.

_When you actually understand a security mechanism you have a lot higher
chance to beat or trick it somehow, than by using a trial and error
approach._

== Embed an XSS payload into our promo video

As with the previous one, the difficulty of this challenge is based on
how hard it is to successfully place the XSS payload in the application.
