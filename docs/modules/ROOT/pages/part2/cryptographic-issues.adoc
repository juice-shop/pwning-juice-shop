== Forge a coupon code that gives you a discount of at least 80%

This is probably one of the hardest challenges in the OWASP Juice Shop.
As you learned during xref:part1/happy-path.adoc#_happy_path[the "happy path" tour], the
web shop offers a __Coupon__ field to get a discount on your entire order
during checkout. The challenge is to get a discount of at least 80% on
an order. As no coupons with this high a discount are published, it is
up to you to forge your own.

== Solve challenge #999

The OWASP Juice Shop is _so broken_ that even its convenience features
(which have nothing to do with the e-commerce use cases) are designed to
be vulnerable. One of these features is
xref:part1/challenges.adoc#_automatic_saving_and_restoring_hacking_progress[Automatic saving and restoring hacking progress]
after a server crash or a few days pause.

In order to not mess with the _real challenges_ accidentally, the
challenge is to fake a signal to the application that you successfully
solved challenge #999 - which does not exist.

== Apply some advanced cryptanalysis to find the real easter egg

Solving the
xref:part2/broken-access-control.adoc#_find_the_hidden_easter_egg[Find the hidden easter egg]
challenge was probably no as satisfying as you had hoped. Now it is time
to tackle the taunt of the developers and hunt down __the real__ easter
egg. This follow-up challenge is basically about finding a secret URL
that - when accessed - will reward you with an easter egg that deserves
the name.

== Unlock Premium Challenge to access exclusive content

These days a lot of seemingly free software comes with hidden or
follow-up costs to use it to its full potential. For example: In
computer games, letting players pay for _Downloadable Content_ (DLC)
after they purchased a full-price game, has become the norm. Often this
is okay, because the developers actually _added_ something worth the
costs to their game. But just as often gamers are supposed to pay for
_just unlocking_ features that were already part of the original
release.

This hacking challenge represents the latter kind of "premium" feature.
_It only exists to rip you hackers off!_ Of course you should never
tolerate such a business policy, let alone support it with your precious
Bitcoins!

That is why the actual challenge here is to unlock and solve the
"premium" challenge _bypassing the paywall_ in front of it.

Side note: The Bitcoin address behind the taunting _Unlock_ button is
actually a valid address of the author. So, if you'd like to donate a
small amount for the ongoing maintenance and development of OWASP
Juice Shop — feel free to actually use it! More on

== Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does

To fulfil this challenge you must identify a cryptographic algorithm (or
crypto library) that either

* should not be used _at all_
* or is a _bad choice_ for a given requirement
* or is used in an _insecure way_.

Initially confined to the realms of academia and the military,
cryptography has become ubiquitous thanks to the Internet. Common
every day uses of cryptography include mobile phones, passwords, SSL,
smart cards, and DVDs. Cryptography has permeated everyday life, and
is heavily used by many web applications.

Cryptography (or crypto) is one of the more advanced topics of
information security, and one whose understanding requires the most
schooling and experience. It is difficult to get right because there
are many approaches to encryption, each with advantages and
disadvantages that need to be thoroughly understood by web solution
architects and developers. In addition, serious cryptography research
is typically based in advanced mathematics and number theory,
providing a serious barrier to entry.

The proper and accurate implementation of cryptography is extremely
critical to its efficacy. A small mistake in configuration or coding
will result in removing a large degree of the protection it affords
and rending the crypto implementation useless against serious attacks.

A good understanding of crypto is required to be able to discern
between solid products and snake oil. The inherent complexity of
crypto makes it easy to fall for fantastic claims from vendors about
their product. Typically, these are "`a breakthrough in cryptography`"
or "`unbreakable`" or provide "military grade" security. If a vendor
says "trust us, we have had experts look at this,`" chances are they
weren't experts!footnote:3_4_1[https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Cryptography]
