= Injection[[_injection]]

include::../attributes.adoc[]

____
Injection flaws allow attackers to relay malicious code through an
application to another system. These attacks include calls to the
operating system via system calls, the use of external programs via
shell commands, as well as calls to backend databases via SQL (i.e.,
SQL injection). Whole scripts written in Perl, Python, and other
languages can be injected into poorly designed applications and
executed. Any time an application uses an interpreter of any type
there is a danger of introducing an injection vulnerability.

Many web applications use operating system features and external
programs to perform their functions. Sendmail is probably the most
frequently invoked external program, but many other programs are used
as well. When a web application passes information from an HTTP
request through as part of an external request, it must be carefully
scrubbed. Otherwise, the attacker can inject special (meta)
characters, malicious commands, or command modifiers into the
information and the web application will blindly pass these on to the
external system for execution.

SQL injection is a particularly widespread and dangerous form of
injection. To exploit a SQL injection flaw, the attacker must find a
parameter that the web application passes through to a database. By
carefully embedding malicious SQL commands into the content of the
parameter, the attacker can trick the web application into forwarding
a malicious query to the database. These attacks are not difficult to
attempt and more tools are emerging that scan for these flaws. The
consequences are particularly damaging, as an attacker can obtain,
corrupt, or destroy database contents.

Injection vulnerabilities can be very easy to discover and exploit,
but they can also be extremely obscure. The consequences of a
successful injection attack can also run the entire range of severity,
from trivial to complete system compromise or destruction. In any
case, the use of external calls is quite widespread, so the likelihood
of an application having an injection flaw should be considered
high.footnote:3_5_1[https://owasp.org/www-community/Injection_Flaws]

== Reconnaissance advice

Instead of trying random attacks or go through an attack pattern list,
it is a good idea to find out if and where a vulnerability exists,
first. By injecting a payload that should typically _break_ an
underlying SQL query (e.g. `'` or `';`) you can analyze how the
behaviour differs from regular use. Maybe you can even provoke an error
where the application leaks details about the query structure and schema
details like table or column names. Do not miss this opportunity.

____
Blind SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a type of SQL
Injection attack that asks the database true or false questions and
determines the answer based on the applications response. This attack
is often used when the web application is configured to show generic
error messages, but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to
SQL injection.

When an attacker exploits SQL injection, sometimes the web application
displays error messages from the database complaining that the SQL
Query's syntax is incorrect. Blind SQL injection is nearly identical
to normal SQL Injection, the only difference being the way the data is
retrieved from the database. When the database does not output data to
the web page, an attacker is forced to steal data by asking the
database a series of true or false questions. This makes exploiting
the SQL Injection vulnerability more difficult, but not
impossible.footnote:3_5_4[https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection]
____

To solve this challenge you need _to order_ a product that is not
supposed to be available any more.

include::../../partials/hints/christmasSpecialChallenge.adoc[]

== Exfiltrate the entire DB schema definition via SQL Injection

An attacker would try to exploit SQL Injection to find out as much as
possible about your database schema. This subsequently allows much more
targeted, stealthy and devastating SQL Injections, like
<<_retrieve_a_list_of_all_user_credentials_via_sql_injection,Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection>>.

== Log in with the (non-existing) accountant without ever registering that user

In ths challenge you need to log in with a user that has
accountant-level permissions, but does not really exist.

== Log in with the administrator's user account

What would a vulnerable web application be without an administrator user
account whose (supposedly) privileged access rights a successful hacker
can abuse?

== Log in with Bender's user account

Bender is a regular customer, but mostly hangs out in the Juice Shop to
troll it for its lack of alcoholic beverages.

== Log in with Jim's user account

Jim is a regular customer. He prefers juice from fruits that no man has
ever tasted before.

____
NoSQL databases provide looser consistency restrictions than
traditional SQL databases. By requiring fewer relational constraints
and consistency checks, NoSQL databases often offer performance and
scaling benefits. Yet these databases are still potentially vulnerable
to injection attacks, even if they aren't using the traditional SQL
syntax. Because these NoSQL injection attacks may execute within a
procedural language, rather than in the declarative SQL language, the
potential impacts are greater than traditional SQL injection.

NoSQL database calls are written in the application's programming
language, a custom API call, or formatted according to a common
convention (such as XML, JSON, LINQ, etc). Malicious input targeting
those specifications may not trigger the primarily application
sanitization checks. For example, filtering out common HTML special
characters such as `< > & ;` will not prevent attacks against a JSON
API, where special characters include `/ { } : `.

There are now over 150 NoSQL databases available for use within an
application, providing APIs in a variety of languages and relationship
models. Each offers different features and restrictions. Because there
is not a common language between them, example injection code will not
apply across all NoSQL databases. For this reason, anyone testing for
NoSQL injection attacks will need to familiarize themselves with the
syntax, data model, and underlying programming language in order to
craft specific tests.

NoSQL injection attacks may execute in different areas of an
application than traditional SQL injection. Where SQL injection would
execute within the database engine, NoSQL variants may execute during
within the application layer or the database layer, depending on the
NoSQL API used and data model. Typically NoSQL injection attacks will
execute where the attack string is parsed, evaluated, or concatenated
into a NoSQL API call.footnote:3_5_2[https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection]

This challenge is about giving the server the chance to catch a breath
by putting it to sleep for a while, making it essentially a
stripped-down _denial-of-service_ attack challenge.

____
In a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, an attacker attempts to prevent
legitimate users from accessing information or services. By targeting
your computer and its network connection, or the computers and network
of the sites you are trying to use, an attacker may be able to prevent
you from accessing email, websites, online accounts (banking, etc.),
or other services that rely on the affected computer.footnote:3_5_3[https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015]

== All your orders are belong to us

This challenge is about retrieving all user's order data from the NoSQL
DB in a single data extraction using an Injection attack.

include::../../partials/hints/noSqlOrdersChallenge.adoc[]

== Update multiple product reviews at the same time

The UI and API only offer ways to update individual product reviews.
This challenge is about manipulating an update so that it will affect
multiple reviews are the same time.

== Infect the server with juicy malware by abusing arbitrary command execution

ℹ️ _Please note that this challenge is *not available* when running
the Juice Shop in either a Docker container or on a Heroku dyno! It is
not possible to implement this vulnerability in a "safe" way without any
risk of compromise of the underlying system._

In this challenge you must exploit a Server-side Template Injection
(SSTi) to "infect" the server with a specially crafted "malware".

include::../../partials/hints/sstiChallenge.adoc[]

____
Server-side template injection occurs when user input is unsafely
embedded into a server-side template, allowing users to inject
template directives. Using malicious template directives, an attacker
may be able to execute arbitrary code and take full control of the web
server.

The severity of this issue varies depending on the type of template
engine being used. Template engines range from being trivial to almost
impossible to exploit. The following steps should be used when
attempting to develop an exploit:

* Identify the type of template engine being used.
* Review its documentation for basic syntax, security considerations,
and built-in methods and variables.
* Explore the template environment and map the attack surface.
* Audit every exposed object and method.

Template injection vulnerabilities can be very serious and can lead to
complete compromise of the application's data and functionality, and
often of the server that is hosting the application. It may also be
possible to use the server as a platform for further attacks against
other systems. On the other hand, some template injection
vulnerabilities may pose no significant security risk. footnote:3_5_5[https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00101080_server-side-template-injection]

== Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection

This challenge explains how a considerable number of companies were
affected by _data breaches_ without anyone breaking into the server room
or sneaking out with a USB stick full of sensitive information. Given
your application is vulnerable to a certain type of SQL Injection
attacks, hackers can have the same effect while comfortably sitting in a
café with free WiFi.
