= Customization[[customization]]

include::../attributes.adoc[]

One of the core usage scenarios for OWASP Juice Shop is in employee
trainings in order to facilitate security awareness. With its not
entirely serious user roster and product inventory the application might
not be suited for all audiences alike.

In some particularly traditional domains or conservative enterprises it
would be beneficial to have the demo application look and behave more
like an internal application.

OWASP Juice Shop can be customized in its product inventory and look &
feel to accommodate this requirement. It also allows to add an arbitrary
number of fake users to make demonstrations - particularly those of
`UNION-SQL` injection attacks - even more impressive. Furthermore the
Challenge solved!-notifications can be turned off in order to keep the
impression of a "real" application undisturbed.

== How to customize the application

The customization is powered by a YAML configuration file placed in
`/config`. To run a customized OWASP Juice Shop you need to:

. Place your own `.yml` configuration file into `/config`
. Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to the filename of your
config without the `.yml` extension
 ** On Windows: `set NODE_ENV=nameOfYourConfig`
 ** On Linux: `export NODE_ENV=nameOfYourConfig`
. Run `npm start`

You can also run a config directly in one command (on Linux) via
`NODE_ENV=nameOfYourConfig npm start`. By default, the
`config/default.yml` config is used which generates the original OWASP
Juice Shop look & feel and inventory. Please note that it is not
necessary to run `npm install` after switching customization
configurations.

=== Overriding `default.yml` in Docker container

In order to override the default configuration inside your Docker
container with one of the provided configs, you can pass in the
`NODE_ENV` environment variable with the `-e` parameter:

[,bash]
----
docker run -d -e "NODE_ENV=bodgeit" -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
----

In order to inject your own configuration, you can use `-v` to mount the
`default.yml` path inside the container to any config file on your
outside file system:

[,bash]
----
docker run -d -e "NODE_ENV=myConfig" -v /tmp/myConfig.yml:/juice-shop/config/myConfig.yml -p 3000:3000 --name juice-shop bkimminich/juice-shop
----

=== Overriding `default.yml` in Vagrant box

Currently it is not possible to override the default configuration in
the Vagrant box. It is not set up in a way where it could pass the
`NODE_ENV` environment variable to the Docker container that is spun up
inside the box.

== YAML configuration file

The YAML format for customizations is very straightforward. Below you
find its schema along with an excerpt of the default settings.

=== Overriding default settings

When creating your own YAML configuration file, you can rely on the
existing default values and only overwrite what you want to change. The
provided `config/ctf.yml` file for capture-the-flag events for example
is as short as this:

[,yaml]
----
application:
  logo: JuiceShopCTF_Logo.png
  favicon: favicon_ctf.ico
  showVersionNumber: false
  showGitHubLinks: false
  welcomeBanner:
    showOnFirstStart: false
challenges:
  showHints: false
  safetyOverride: true
hackingInstructor:
  isEnabled: false
ctf:
  showFlagsInNotifications: true
----

=== Testing customizations

You can validate your custom configuration file against the schema by
running `+npm run lint:config -- -f /path/to/myConfig.yml+`. This
validation automatically happens on server startup as well.

To verify if your custom configuration will not break any of the
challenges, you should run the end-to-end tests via `npm start & npm run cypress:open &`. If they pass, all challenges will be working fine!

== Material Color Themes

The `application.theme` property allows certain pre-defined color
schemes. The table below shows sample screenshots for each of these.

|===
| Theme | Sample screenshot

| `bluegrey-lightgreen`
| image:part1/material-theme_bluegrey-lightgreen.png[]

| `blue-lightblue`

== Provided customizations

The following fully re-themed customizations are provided out of the box
by OWASP Juice Shop for demonstration purposes:

* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/7ms.yml[7 Minute Security]:
Full conversion https://7ms.us-theme for the first podcast that
picked up the Juice Shop way before it was famous! 😎
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/mozilla.yml[Mozilla-CTF]:
Another full conversion theme harvested and refined from the
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/hands-on-web-security-capture-the-flag-with-owasp-juice-shop[Mozilla Austin CTF-event]!
🦊
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/addo.yml[AllDayDeflOps]:
This full conversion had its live debut at the
https://www.alldaydevops.com/[All Day DevOps 2019] conference and
was released the same day! 🎀
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/bodgeit.yml[The BodgeIt Store]:
An homage to
https://github.com/psiinon/bodgeit[our server-side rendered ancestor].
May it rest in JSPs! 💀
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/juicebox.yml[OWASP Juice Box]:
If you find _jo͞osbäks_ much easier to pronounce than _jo͞osSHäp_,
this customization is for you. 🧃

Furthermore these convenience customizations are provided out-of-the-box
to simplify usage of OWASP Juice Shop in specific use cases and
situations:

* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/ctf.yml[CTF-mode]:
Keeps the Juice Shop in its default layout but disabled hints while
enabling CTF flag codes in the _"challenge solved"_-notifications.
Refer to xref:part1/ctf.adoc#_hosting_a_ctf_event[Hosting a CTF event] to learn more about running a
CTF-event with OWASP Juice Shop. 🚩
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/quiet.yml[Quiet mode]:
Keeps the Juice Shop in its default layout but hides all _"challenge
solved"_-notifications, GitHub ribbon and challenge hints. 🔇
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/tutorial.yml[Tutorial mode]:
Restricts the user to first solve all challenges with
xref:part1/challenges.adoc#_hacking_instructor[Hacking Instructor] tutorials
before the entire __Score Board__ gets unlocked and filterable. 🏫
Hidden challenges can still be solved and users will receive
corresponding success notifications!
* https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/config/unsafe.yml[Unsafe mode]:
Keeps everything at default settings except _enabling_ all
xref:part1/challenges.adoc#_potentially_dangerous_challenges[potentially dangerous challenges]
even in containerized environments. ☠️ *Use at your own risk!*

image::part1/theme_bodgeit.png[BodgeIt Store theme]

== Proprietary customization

Below you find screenshots of a custom theme the author of this book created for awareness and demo sessions at work. It was presented to various groups and individuals, from Project Manager rounds over workers council members up to the company CEO at that time.

image:part1/theme_kn3.png[2FA setup in Kuehne+Nagel theme]
image:part1/theme_kn4.png[Customer feedback in Kuehne+Nagel theme]

== Limitations

* When running a customization (except `default.yml`) that overwrites
the property `application.domain`, the description of the challenges
_Ephemeral Accountant_, _Forged Signed JWT_ and _Unsigned JWT_ will
always be shown in English.
* Configurations (except `default.yml`) do not support translation of
custom product names and descriptions as of {juiceShopVersion}.
* Several
xref:part1/challenges.adoc#_hacking_instructor[Hacking Instructor]
scripts depend on product inventory and product reviews that might not
exist in the required form when you overwrote the default `products`
list. Consider turning off the tutorials by setting
`hackingInstructor.isEnabled` to `false` in that case.

== Additional Browser tweaks

Consider you are doing a live demo with a highly customized corporate
theme. Your narrative is, that this _really_ is an upcoming eCommerce
application _of that company_. xref:part1/happy-path.adoc#_happy_path[Walking the "happy path"]
might now lure you into two situations which could spoil the immersion
for the audience.

[discrete]
==== Coupon codes on social media

If you configured the `twitterUrl`/`facebookUrl` as the company's own
account/page, you will most likely not find any coupon codes posted
there. You will probably fail to convince the social media team to tweet
or retweet some coupon code for an application that does not even exist!

image::part1/coupon_immersion-spoiler.png[Coupon Immersion Spoiler]

[discrete]
==== OAuth Login

Another immersion spoiler occurs when demonstrating the _Log in with
Google_ functionality, which will show you the application name
registered on Google Cloud Platform: _OWASP Juice Shop_! There is no way
to convince Google to show anything else for obvious trust and integrity
reasons.

image::part1/oauth_immersion-spoiler.png[OAuth Immersion Spoiler]

ℹ️ _Since v10.0.0 you can overwrite the
<<_googleoauth_subsection,`googleOauth` subsection>> to use your own
application on Google Cloud Platform for handling OAuth. This is a
relatively high effort, so maybe you want to kill two birds with one
stone instead as described in the next section._

=== On-the-fly text replacement

You can solve both of the above problems _in your own Browser_ by
replacing text on the fly when the Twitter, Facebook or Google-Login
page is loaded. For Chrome
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-replacer-ii/djakfbefalbkkdgnhkkdiihelkjdpbfh?hl=en[Word Replacer II]
is a plugin that does this work for you with very little setup effort.
For Firefox
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/[FoxReplace]
does a similar job. After installing either plugin you have to create
two text replacements:

. Create a replacement for `OWASP Juice Shop` (as it appears on
Google-Login) with your own application name. Best use
`application.name` from your configuration.
. Create another replacement for a complete or partial Tweet or
Facebook post with some marketing text and an actual coupon code. You
can get valid coupon codes from the OWASP Juice Shop Twitter feed:
https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop.
+
image::part1/word_replacer_ii.png[Word Replacer II]

. Enable the plugin and verify your replacements work:
