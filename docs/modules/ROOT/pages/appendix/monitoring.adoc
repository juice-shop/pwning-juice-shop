You can monitor your local or cloud-hosted OWASP Juice Shop instance
using internally gathered metrics and visualize those on dashboards.

== Prometheus Metrics

Juice Shop collects functional and technical metrics using a
https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] client module. Its endpoint is
publicly accessible and there is even a challenge asking you to
"xref:part2/sensitive-data-exposure.adoc#_find_the_endpoint_that_serves_usage_data_to_be_scraped_by_a_popular_monitoring_system[Find the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a popular monitoring system]".

To consume these metrics you need to set up a Prometheus server which is
very straightforward:

. https://prometheus.io/download/[Install Prometheus] on the machine
that will monitor your Juice Shop instance
. Configure your Juice Shop instance as a scraping target in the
`prometheus.yml`. A simple config example you can find below.
. Start your Prometheus server which by default runs on
http://localhost:9090
. Check if your scraping endpoint shows "UP" as its state at
http://localhost:9090/targets

----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'juiceshop_local'
    scrape_interval: 30s
    scrape_timeout: 10s
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:3000']
----

You can create dashboards and alert rules in Prometheus itself, but if
you want to have a fancy dashboard like the one in the screenshots
above, you need a bit more visualization firepower.

== Grafana Dashboard

This is where https://grafana.com/[Grafana] comes in. Juice Shop comes
with a full-fledged `JSON` template that you can import as a new
dashboard into your own Grafana installation. It consumes and displays
all metrics gathered via Prometheus as seen in the screenshots above.

. https://grafana.com/get[Install Grafana] (for ease-of-use, best use
the machine you also have Prometheus running on)
. Start Grafana and visit it at http://localhost:3000 (ℹ️ _Its
default port is the same as Juice Shop's, so if you run both on the
same machine, one needs to be moved to a different port._)
. Log in with `admin`/`admin`.
. Go to _Configuration_ > _Data Sources_ at
http://localhost:3000/datasourcesand click _Add data source_
. Select _Prometheus_ and in its configuration screen set
http://localhost:9090 as the _HTTP_ > _URL_. Clicking _Save & Test_
will confirm if Grafana could find your Prometheus server.
. Now go to _Dashboards_ > _Manage_ at
http://localhost:3000/dashboards
. Click _Import_ and either upload or paste the contents of the
https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json[`monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json`]
found in the Juice Shop's GitHub repository.
. Now visit the imported _Juice Shop Instance Dashboard_ by clicking on
its name to view it! Voilá!

ℹ️ _The "Juice Shop Instance Dashboard" template was forked from the
multi-instance dashboard of
xref:appendix/trainers.adoc#_hosting_individual_instances_for_multiple_users[MultiJuicer],
so if you need to run and subsequently monitor multiple Juice Shop
instances, best take a look at
https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer[MultiJuicer] and our
xref:appendix/trainers.adoc#_trainers_guide[Trainer's guide]._
