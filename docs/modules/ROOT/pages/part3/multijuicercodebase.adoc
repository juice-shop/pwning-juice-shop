= MultiJuicer Codebase 101 & Contributor's Guide

This document serves as the main entry point for the MultiJuicer 
codebase. It provides an overview of the codebase, its structure, 
and how to navigate it as a contributor. We recommend reading 
through the xref:part3/contribution.adoc[contributing guide of Juice Shop 
to learn about the common standards and practices]. Also, this is a 
project based on Golang and Kubernetes. Getting familiar with these technologies 
will be essential for contributing effectively:

* **Go Programming Language**: MultiJuicer's backend components are written in Go. 
If you're new to Go, start with the 
https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started[official Go tutorial] 
and refer to the https://go.dev/doc/effective_go[Effective Go] 
guide for best practices.

* **Kubernetes**: The project heavily relies on Kubernetes for orchestration and 
resource management. 
The https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/[Kubernetes Basics tutorial] and 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/[API reference documentation] are excellent 
starting points.
The https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/[Tasks section] provides practical examples 
for common operations.

It is not required to go in depth but at the very least basic understanding of Kubernetes
and Go syntax would be appreciated.

== What is MultiJuicer? [[what-is-multijuicer]]

As described in the main `readme.md`, MultiJuicer solves the 
challenge of running OWASP Juice Shop instances for multiple 
users simultaneously, typically during CTFs or security training 
sessions. It provides a central platform on Kubernetes that 
dynamically provisions and manages isolated Juice Shop instances 
for each team or participant.

=== Core Features

* **Dynamic Instance Provisioning:** Creates Juice Shop instances
 on demand when a team joins.
* **Load Balancing/Proxying:** Routes user traffic to their 
specific Juice Shop instance based on a secure cookie.
* **Progress Persistence:** Backs up solved challenges 
to Kubernetes annotations,
 allowing progress to survive pod restarts.
* **Automated Cleanup:** Removes old, inactive instances 
based on a configurable duration.
* **Scoreboard & Admin UI:** Provides visibility into 
team progress and administrative controls.

== High-Level Architecture [[high-level-architecture]]

MultiJuicer consists of three main backend components running in 
Kubernetes, plus a frontend UI served by the Balancer:

1. **Balancer:**
   * The main user entry point.
   * Serves the React-based UI for joining/creating teams and viewing 
   status/scores.
   * Handles API requests for team management (join, logout, reset passcode).
   * Creates/manages Kubernetes `Deployment` and `Service` resources 
   for each Juice Shop instance.
   * Acts as a reverse proxy, routing authenticated user traffic to 
   their corresponding Juice Shop instance.
   * Provides an admin interface for managing instances.
   * Calculates and caches scoreboard data.
2. **Progress Watchdog:**
   * Listens for webhook notifications sent by individual Juice Shop 
   instances when a challenge is solved.
   * Patches the corresponding team's Kubernetes `Deployment` resource, 
   updating annotations (`multi-juicer.owasp-juice.shop/...`) to 
   store the list of solved challenges, and the count
   * Includes a background sync mechanism to periodically check 
   running Juice Shops and ensure annotation data matches the 
   instance's state, applying backed-up progress if needed.
3. **Cleaner:**
   * Runs periodically as a Kubernetes `CronJob`.
   * Lists all Juice Shop `Deployment` resources managed by MultiJuicer.
   * Checks the `multi-juicer.owasp-juice.shop/lastRequest` annotation 
   timestamp.
   * If an instance has been inactive for longer than the configured 
   duration (`MAX_INACTIVE_DURATION`), it deletes the corresponding 
   `Deployment` and `Service`.

=== 4. Component Deep Dive

* *`balancer`:*
  ** Written in Go using the standard `net/http` library.
  ** `main.go`: Sets up the HTTP server and routes.
  ** `routes/`: Contains handlers for different API endpoints (`/balancer/api/...`) and the main proxy logic (`/`).
    *** `proxy.go`: Handles routing requests to the correct Juice Shop instance based on the team cookie and updates the `lastRequest` annotation.
    *** `join.go`: Handles team creation/joining, passcode generation/verification, and creates Juice Shop Deployments/Services via the Kubernetes API.
    *** `scoring.go` (in `pkg/scoring`): Calculates scores based on annotations read from Juice Shop deployments.
  ** `ui/`: A React/TypeScript application built with Vite, providing the user interface for joining teams, viewing status, scoreboard, and admin functions.
* *`progress-watchdog`:*
  ** Written in Go.
  ** `main.go`: Listens for HTTP POST requests on `/team/{team}/webhook`.
  ** `internal/kubernetes.go`: Handles patching the Juice Shop Deployment annotations (`challenges`, `challengesSolved`).
  ** `internal/background-sync.go`: Periodically checks Juice Shop instances to ensure progress consistency (re-applies progress from annotations if needed).
* *`cleaner`:*
  ** Written in Go.
  ** Periodically removes inactive Juice Shop instances.
  ** `main.go`: Designed to be run as a CronJob. It lists Juice Shop Deployments, checks the `lastRequest` annotation, and deletes Deployments/Services older than the configured `MAX_INACTIVE_DURATION`.
* *`helm/multi-juicer`:*
  ** Defines all necessary Kubernetes resources.
  ** `values.yaml` is the primary way to configure a MultiJuicer deployment.
  ** Uses Go templating for Kubernetes manifests.
